The domain and website of my namesake is dead. [Nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com), the online home I&#8217;ve held to show off my creative pursuits for nearly a decade, is now merely an A record on a DNS server pointing to my new cozy spot at [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com).

The folks at BC make it ridiculously easy, and maybe even a little fun, to upload, organize, and even occasionally sell my work to the Internets. Their artist template is plain, but effective. It&#8217;s iconic without really being sophisticated. And a lot of music I&#8217;ve listened to lately has come from there. I dig them. I dig them so much that I realized my focus was to just provide access to the music I&#8217;ve done and&#8230;basically nothing else. Bandcamp does that better than I ever have.

My initial goal when I first got serious about web development was to create an online database of all my music (and even instrumental characteristics) so that it was accessible from anywhere and easily searchable. I then went ahead and did that. And it was good! But it was also never quite done, nor was it even used very much. I&#8217;ve written a lot of music and cataloging it was tedious. A lot of it was essentially detritus, having no association with an album, nor even a finished form. Lots of sketches got onto the site just for the sake of completion. Over the years I came to find that it&#8217;s just not worth keeping such detailed track of every idea I come up with.

In the middle of writing both Zoetic and the Impulse (OST), I decided to get more serious about selling my music and trying to be &#8220;pro&#8221;. Most of my web development is being done at work, so I&#8217;m less ambitious about personal projects. I have not lost my obsession with making and recording music, however. So I just did what a lot of people do: I outsourced. This blog here is my main &#8220;hey, I&#8217;m on the Internet&#8221; vehicle now, and Bandcamp takes care of the music. It&#8217;s a good deal.

Will nebyoolae.com ever become grounds for a future web project? It&#8217;s definitely possible with the ease my mind changes gears, but for now it&#8217;ll be used as the front door to what I&#8217;ve really wanted it to be all along: the music I&#8217;ve made that you should really give a listen to.
