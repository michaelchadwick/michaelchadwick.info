Sometimes it&#8217;s OK to just rock really loudly in an electronica fashion. That&#8217;s exactly what [Majicking](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/majicking) is all about.

You may remember some old tracks I did under the name Majic. They were the first electronica pieces I&#8217;d ever tried after doing countless guitar recordings. Ever since I got Logic Pro and its mountain of loops and synths, I&#8217;ve been toying with tons of ideas.

Welcome to the final genesis of all that noodling.

P.S. I created a new Twitter account just for announcing stuff like this. Unsurprisingly, it is [Nebyoomuz](http://twitter.com/nebyoomuz).
