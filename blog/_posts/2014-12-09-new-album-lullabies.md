[Lullabies, by Michael Chadwick](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/lullabies)

Sometimes, you just need some relaxing solo classical guitar to lull a young person into a state of unconsciousness. In order to facilitate this, or maybe just to offer up a collection of pleasant music to play in the background for some other task, I made a [Lullabies album](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/lullabies). The whole shebang is pay-what-you-will, or you can just stream for free.

It&#8217;s pretty raw, one-take stuff, so the tempo may meander, and the recording is nowhere near professional, but I think that just makes them more authentic.

_Note_: technically, these lullabies have no words, and they aren&#8217;t always in 6/8 time, so they may not have the [traditional characteristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullaby#Characteristics) of the art form, **but they can still work**! I&#8217;ve used these pieces personally, and I think they will do the trick. I&#8217;ve even had the whole album approved by a _real mother_, so I think I know what I&#8217;m talking about. Besides, babies won&#8217;t know they&#8217;re not the real thing, man.
