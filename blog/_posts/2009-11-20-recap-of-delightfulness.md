Jonface visited a few weekends ago. We played board games, his car was broken into, and burritos were eaten. 2/3 of that was awesome.

Anna visited more recently. We finished making favors, a florist was investigated, and Up was watched. All of that was awesome.

Video games visit regularly. I started playing Mass Effect, I participated in multiple-monitor Forza 3, and I got Torchlight to run in Win 7 Boot Camp after failing to run it in Virtualbox. Most of that was awesome.

And that is a disjointed recap.

Also, Chrome OS looks pretty sweet, but what about Logic and Photoshop and Final Cut Pro? Obv, to quote the Internet, it may not be for someone who uses a computer 10+ hours a day. Like me.
