_Note:_ these albums didn&#8217;t necessarily come out in 2016, but I listened to them A LOT in 2016 (I&#8217;m behind on a few things)

<!--more-->

* [Songs For Broadcast: part II](https://breakmastercylinder.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-broadcast-part-ii) by [Breakmaster Cylinder](https://breakmastercylinder.bandcamp.com)
  * Learned about this artist via the [Reply All](http://replyall.limo) podcast (BC did their theme). Good mix of stuff that just kind of rules.
* [Pulse](https://sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com/album/pulse) by [Sithu Aye](https://sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com)
  * When I need an indie Joe Satriani fix.
* [Trilogy](https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com/album/trilogy) by [Carpenter Brut](https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com)
  * Hotline Miami 2 brought me the intense synthwave stylings of Mr. Brut, and I am all the better for it. This album is his entire Bandcamp output so far.
* [Retro-Active Pt. 1](http://store.bravewave.net/album/retro-active-pt-1) and [Retro-Active Pt. 2](http://store.bravewave.net/album/retro-active-pt-2) by [Keiji Yamagishi](http://store.bravewave.net)
  * It took me far too long to finally check out these albums by the composer of the original Ninja Gaiden soundtracks. Great electronica.
* [Island Universe](http://30thfloor.uk/album/island-universe) by [Syntax](https://soundcloud.com/syntax201)
  * I forget where I found this originally, but it&#8217;s some really sweet, chilled-out, 80s synthwave. Transportive and relaxing in a unique way.
* [Lunaria](https://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/album/lunaria) by [Daminal Cannon](https://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com)
  * Chiptune and badass instrumental guitar rock come together in a tight, blissful package.
* [BlastPortable](https://tempsoundsolutions.bandcamp.com/album/temp-sound-solutions-and-alex-mauer-present-blast-portable) by [temp sound solutions](https://tempsoundsolutions.bandcamp.com) and alex mauer
  * A random [blog post](http://www.gamemusic4all.com/blog/2016/5/3/listen-to-fusion-of-chiptune-rock-zaxxoff-by-temp-sound-solutions-alex-mauer) linked me to [one song](https://tempsoundsolutions.bandcamp.com/track/tony-danza) on this album, and I immediately fell in love with both it, and the rest of the album. I&#8217;d seen temp sound solutions on other random Bandcamp releases, but somehow never got into them, despite their dozens of releases. This may be the start of a new collection, though. Also, I specifically thank [logear level 4-2](https://tempsoundsolutions.bandcamp.com/track/logear-level-4-2) on infinite repeat one evening while I hacked away at a game project: its punishing loop of minor key tension really did the trick for some reason.
* [Interventions](https://horselords.bandcamp.com/album/interventions) by [Horse Lords](https://horselords.bandcamp.com)
  * This band is one of the most surprising discoveries I&#8217;ve made in a while, due to their unique sound. As producers of an amalgamation they describe as &#8220;West African rhythms collide with just intonation guitars, art-fire saxophone, minimalist grooves, and collaged zapdowns&#8221;, I will just say it&#8217;s unlike anything else in my catalogue.
