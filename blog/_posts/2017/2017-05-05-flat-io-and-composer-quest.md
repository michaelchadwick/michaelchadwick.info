A few months ago one of my favorite podcasts ended. I was actually on [Composer Quest](http://composerquest.com) a few times as a guest, and the host even stayed with me for a night during his World Tour. All in all, Charlie made a very cool thing, and I&#8217;ll miss it.

Before it ended, however, there was a challenge called the [Composer Quest Olympics](http://composerquest.com/olympics). Six events, each one with its own Olympic event theme. The second event was called Table Tennis, and I got paired up with a guy named Jared Coffin to compose something in a back-and-forth manner, just like table tennis itself.

The finished product is here:

However, the initial seed was done in [Flat.io](http://flat.io), which is a great tool and works like Sibelius on the Web. They recently started allowing you to embed your scores in a neat little `iframe`, and so I can share the rough origin of the track (that is, without the improved timing, instrument, and effects).
