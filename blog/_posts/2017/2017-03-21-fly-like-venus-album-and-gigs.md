The sweet rock band I&#8217;m currently in, [Fly Like Venus](http://flylikevenus.com), is getting more legit everyday.

**News The One**: we&#8217;re currently recording the final track of our first album. It&#8217;s kind of the power ballad of the whole thing, and so has a nice quiet beginning that gets rocking later. Once that&#8217;s done we can send it off for mastering, and then we&#8217;ll have something to show off to everyone who hasn&#8217;t been holed up in a garage once a week for over a year.

**News the Two**: we just played a show at a friendly little bar in town and rocked their doors off. I feel bad that the first two songs were a bit out of tune, which was largely my fault, but I think we made up for it. Not used to doing these kinds of things, so I&#8217;m off my game on the &#8220;playing live&#8221; tip. In fact, I&#8217;m going to get more practice very soonish, because we have a couple gigs lined up in the next few months (and a few more in the works).

**News the Three**: a new live video for &#8220;Scenes from My Window&#8221; appears!
