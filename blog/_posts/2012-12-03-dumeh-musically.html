<p>There's this little project I've been working on for about, oh, a <em>decade</em> now. I call it "Dumeh". It's a <em>modern</em> (meaning it's probably a little too pop-ish, has a drumkit, and I wrote it in the 2000s) symphony in three parts (fast-slow-fast), and is in the key of Cm (I think!; not good at that kind of thing, actually). I'm working with a local union of musicians to get it performed and recorded all legitimate-like in the next few months, which I'm incredibly ecstatic about.</p>

<p>The whole shebang is 7-8 minutes long and includes all the usual orchestra members you'd expect, but the very intro is played by a single instrument. Here's the main intro theme, as originally written for guitar:</p>

<div class="vextab-auto" title="The intro to 'Dumeh'" width="570">

notes :8 (3/5.0/3.1/2) (3/5.0/3.3/2) | :q (3/5.0/3.4/2) 3h4p3/2 3/2 0/3 | :h (3/5.3/4.0/3.3/2) 3s1/2 0/3<br />

<p>The timing is not well-represented, but you sort of get...<em>something</em> out of the above, right? This may be my favorite creation of all time. It's not musically insane or anything, but the rhythm has a nice flow, and chords are a bit unsettling, yet still tasty.</p>

<p>The piano version of this, which is what the finished product will use, is more complex, but the gist is the same. Bringing full-on creation to a riff I came up with over 10 years ago...well, it's gonna be a dream come true.</p>
