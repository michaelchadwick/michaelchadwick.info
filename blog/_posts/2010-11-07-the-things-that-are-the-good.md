It was a pretty run-of-the-mill Sunday, but lots of good things happened anyway. And now&#8230;a list:

  * [Yummy brunch](http://alchemysandiego.com/)
  * Holding a friend&#8217;s [child](http://hour23.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/mg_5092.jpg?w=330&h=351)
  * Shopping with Robyn
  * Painting another room of the house (exercise/study room is now a [soft yellow](http://flic.kr/p/8RJzNo))
  * Selling some old stuff on Craigslist for some quick cash
  * Dinner + Numbers
  * [Banana ice cream](http://cooklikeyourgrandmother.com/2010/07/worlds-easiest-ice-cream-recipe/) (food process semi-frozen bananas; serve in bowl)

And now I&#8217;m in bed with Robyn, blogging about all of that. Life is good.
