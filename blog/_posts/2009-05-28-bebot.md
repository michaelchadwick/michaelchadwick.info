I love this iPhone app. It&#8217;s a four-track analog synth for only $1.99. A cute little 1950s robot is your avatar and he belts out sine waves with the best of them. Lots of options and a great interface make this fun as hell.

But don&#8217;t take **my** word for it. Take [Jordan Rudess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFG7-Q0WI7Q) (from Dream Theater)&#8217;s word for it.
