Another entry in the now-illustrious &#8220;The Matic&#8221; music video line is now up. This time it features a family cruise to Alaska. Starting in Vancouver, Canada, we shipped out to Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway, and finally ended in Whittier, wherein my wife and I took a bus ride through a mountain to Anchorage.

The rest of the family went on to Fairbanks by way of a train through Denali National Park, but that story will have to be told another day by someone else!

&#8220;Alaska Yo Ho&#8221; features an upbeat, RPG-ish march called &#8220;King for a Weeknight&#8221; to accompany the scenic water, tree, and mountain viewscapes. Enjoy!
