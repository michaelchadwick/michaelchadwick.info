<p>As evidenced by the subject, I'm on <a href="https://github.com/nebyoolae">Github</a>.</p>

<p>A year-or-so ago I created my very first <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> plugin. It was total crap sauce. <strong>Then</strong>, I created my <em>second</em> jQuery plugin and it's kind of useful!</p>

<p>It's called <a href="https://github.com/michaelchadwick/jquery-news-list">News List</a> and it takes a simple little HTML structure and turns it into an auto-cycling slideshow of items. You see these things on the top of any kind of news site all the time, and they're probably a lot more complicated and pretty than mine. But they were not created by me, and this one is!</p>

<p>Your eyes and minds can feast on it <a href="https://github.com/michaelchadwick/jquery-news-list">here</a>.</p>
