I&#8217;ve been listening to [Composer Quest](http://composerquest.com) for years, spurred on by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wtrebella/status/291375926242054144?lang=en) from a Mr. Whitaker Trebella, who is a friend of the podcast host, Charlie McCarron.

Besides interviews with people in the creative field, and helpful audio workshops where Charlie goes over music production on tracks he&#8217;s recently created, they also do **quests**, which are compositional challenges. I try to do them when I can (or am even able!), but I definitely tried my hardest to stick it through the latest one: **Composer Quest Olympics**. A series of events, like Weightlifting and Hurdles, each proposed a different constraint for that section&#8217;s composition, and 10 days later it was due. I dig constraints, as it gives the otherwise unlimited potential for a single piece of music some guidance.

Well, six challenges, two-ish months, and an awards ceremony later, [the CQ Olympics are complete](http://www.charliemccarron.com/2016/11/composer-quest-olympics-the-results/): and I won 3 medals! Two were for challenges I did with one or more people, and one was for a solo effort.

It&#8217;s exciting to win anything at anytime, even though I was surprised on the ones I won for, and the one I thought was a shoo-in got 0 votes. I guess I don&#8217;t know what the people (read: this specific audience) was really looking for. Alas!
