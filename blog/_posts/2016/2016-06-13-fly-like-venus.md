As an addendum to the last post, I would be remiss to forget to talk about [Fly Like Venus](http://flylikevenus.com) for a little bit.

<!--more-->

Except for [Pure Yellow Colour](http://pyc.nebyoolae.com), I&#8217;ve never been in a &#8220;band&#8221;, per se. I&#8217;ve been playing and making music since the mid-90s, and sometimes with other people informally, but most of the time the music has been a solo project.

Enter my friend Rusty, who, back in the early 2000s, was just a friend of my boss at the time. Rusty played drums, and my boss played guitar and sang, and they would occasionally jam. I joined in with them after some time, and we started doing some rough recordings of our jams for fun. I left that job and that boss eventually moved, so that whole thing kind of died on the vine, unfortunately.

Thankfully, I kept in touch with Rusty, and we eventually got together again to jam here and there. Oftentimes it would just be us, but we occasionally brought in other musicians, too. The revolving lineup and its output has been documented at the [Man Cave Jam](http://mcj.nebyoolae.com) website.

In the last year or so, we got a lead guitarist/vocalist and a bassist, and began trying to become more legit as a band. We decided on a name, started recording an [album](https://soundcloud.com/fly-like-venus/wondering-why), and even just played our [first gig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIQngMeLNdw) at an open-mic (and people came to see us!). So, I guess you could say we&#8217;re _kind of a big deal_ now.

It&#8217;s a cool thing to be in, and playing with other people, especially when you&#8217;re all on your game and everything comes together, can be a high like no other.
