I had a friend (continue to) stand in front of a scenic overlook while we were perched atop a hill in Julian recently. He was standing there, most likely taking in the majesty of nature, and I figured it would make a good shot. I said to not move, he remained motionless and I clicked the button on the camera. The result was pretty good. Also, it was cold.
