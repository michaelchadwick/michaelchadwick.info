Just finished watching the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode entitled &#8220;Chain of Command.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one where Crusher, Worf, and Picard go on a seekrit mission and Picard gets captured by the Cardassians. He is then systematically tortured for a while, wherein the Internet eventually received the &#8220;There are&#8230;four lights!&#8221; meme.

It&#8217;s mentioned by Picard that torture is usually unreliable, and that it&#8217;s hard to see why it&#8217;s even used. In the end, it comes down to revenge power fantasies, not actual information gathering. I&#8217;ve never been tortured, nor have I seen someone in real life be tortured, so I don&#8217;t know how accurate this is. I&#8217;m reasonably assured it happens and despite the show&#8217;s philosophy, I would think people would break all the time and give up information if they have it. TV seems to think that never happens and the person being tortured either doesn&#8217;t know or won&#8217;t give it up or just makes up anything needed to stop the torture. Regardless, it&#8217;s brutal, time-consuming, and just plain sadistic.

Brian Warner, the actor playing the Cardassian interrogator, did a good job, as well did Patrick Stewart (AS IF THAT WERE IN QUESTION). It&#8217;s a classic episode that makes you think. Hey, it inspired a whole post from me, at least.
