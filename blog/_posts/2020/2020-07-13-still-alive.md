Neither the [Portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI) or [Mirror&#8217;s Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TERyxFfMqDk) theme song, but true all the same: I&#8217;m still alive, kicking, and making music. None of that music is ready to drop online just yet, but it&#8217;s in the works.

Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s cooking:

* **[Nebyoolae](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com)** &#8211; _instrumental rock and electronic bops_
  * **Hindslight**: a huge collection of instrumental rock pieces I&#8217;ve been tinkering with for, well, years. I may actually break this up into two albums.
  * **OPM**: short for &#8220;Other People&#8217;s Music&#8221;, this is a cover/remix album. I&#8217;m packaging together several pieces from the past that were only on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/nebyoolae), but first I need to see if they still open in the newest Logic and give them some spit &#8216;n&#8217; shine.
* **[Fenchy](https://fenchy.bandcamp.com)** &#8211; _pop-rock with lyrics_
  * **Drama Nerd EP**: this 4-track release comes from waaaaaay back in my history. One of the pieces was literally written while I was in college and uses a poem from an ex-girlfriend for its lyrics.
  * **Billion Grains of Rice**: my first full-length album as Fenchy. So far, I&#8217;ve dropped just one album as Fenchy so far and it was only an EP for [RPM April 2020](https://fenchy.bandcamp.com/album/puttery). This will hopefully be the first _real_ release.
* **[Fly Like Venus](https://flylikevenus.bandcamp.com)** &#8211; _alt-funk-rock with lyrics_
  * **Album #2**: the rock band (with other people!) I&#8217;m in is still in the middle of writing and recording our second album. Due to COVID-19, we haven&#8217;t been able to practice with each other since mid-March 2020, so&#8230;this is gonna take longer than anticipated.
* **[Massive Battery](https://soundcloud.com/massive-battery)** &#8211; electronic beats using only NI [Massive](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive/) and [Battery](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/drums/battery-4/), and tons of vocal samples
  * None at this time.
