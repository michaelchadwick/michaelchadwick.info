Meeting Josh back in college eventually lead to meeting Matt and Molly. Over the course of five years they and several others built a house in the country northeast of where I live. We got to check it out this weekend, staying over one night and then partying with a bunch of people today. It&#8217;s situated along a gravel road, and there are trees all over the place.

The house is awesome and fun to hang out in. There&#8217;s a big open room where the living room, kitchen, and dining room all lie. Everything has a cabin-in-the-woods vibe that is homey and comfortable. To think they designed and built everything in it is astonishing to me. A project of that magnitude just overwhelms me. All my accomplishments seem to be digital, and anyone who makes something analog like this leaves me speechless.

Of course, no matter how much time I spend hanging out with friends and chilling in a cool house in the woods I still enjoy coming home to wherever I live. The neighbors are throwing a party of their own right now, actually, which is less than pleasing, especially since we just came from the near-silence of the country. Ah&#8230;this is what you give up for living closer to civilization, I guess.
