Our house is awesome. It&#8217;s big and airy and when in the main living space feels reaaaaaally huge because it&#8217;s not enclosed and you can look from the first-and-a-half floor all the way up to the third floor. **Painting** this sweet room-that-encompasses-many-rooms is not so awesome. In fact, it took 4 days, 7 gallons of paint, a 22&#8242; ladder, and an extended paint roller connected to a 12&#8242; extension pole to reach the very top of some of the walls. We&#8217;re done now, but it was an epic adventure that left both Robyn and I tired, sore, and mentally exhausted.
