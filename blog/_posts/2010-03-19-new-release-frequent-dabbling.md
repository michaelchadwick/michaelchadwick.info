Another new release, you say? Yes, I say.

2010 has been a productive musical year so far. And I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Getting around to finishing all of these musical ideas really makes me happy, and hopefully you enjoy listening.

A smattering of old ideas finally coming to fruition is what you&#8217;ll find in Frequent Dabbling. Check it out in the [music](http://nebyoolae.com/music) section.
