It's now 2022 (or 2020 2, if you're cheeky), and time for a blog-type announcement dealio: NebyooBlog, formerly [here](https://blog.nebyoolae.com), is finally shutting down...

...so it can be integrated here ;P

I've been using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for years to make my dev blog, **Codaname** (you're already here, congrats!). However, at the tail end of 2021, I started re-assessing my digital assets. Having multiple personalities or personas makes things complicated.

During the beforetimes when I thought it was a good idea, I was largely trying to figure out who I _was_ on the Internet. In real life, I'm _me_, but online I can be various **me**s, depending on the context. This is a useful ability, but also a stressful one, because then you have to **keep up** with all the **me**s.

Thus, in the spirit of simplification, I've decided that I am both a musician and a developer, _and_ those two things **can coexist in one blog**. So, **NebyooBlog** is no more :skull: (but the URL will still work, just redirected here), and **Codaname** is the only _identity_ I'm pursuing any further. There will henceforth be posts about programming and about making music and possibly about making music using programming. This change also means I won't have to personally deal with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) plugin updates and security issues anymore.

And that's, well, **_me_**.
