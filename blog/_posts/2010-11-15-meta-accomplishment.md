Accomplishment is a drug. Each time you successfully achieve something you get a little rush. Dopamine or seratonin or some kind of neurotransmitter is released and you&#8217;re doing all right. But what about when you don&#8217;t have time to finish something? What if you can&#8217;t actually finish it because you&#8217;re not able? What if the end goal is just not within reach at this very moment? You need a hit of that accomplishment energy, so you gotta do something.

Meta-accomplishments, man.

To use solo web development as an example, feel free to try the following things:

  * Make flowchart diagrams and wireframes
  * Create documentation
  * Install and update project management software
  * Read a tech article related to your project
  * Help a co-worker or friend with something
  * Solve a puzzling mind teaser
  * Play a quick session of a game

The point of these is that they&#8217;re often simpler and quicker to accomplish than your actual main work, and yet they still help you finish or augment that in an indirect way. In the end, you won&#8217;t be directly furthering your main work, but you&#8217;ll have gotten something done and you&#8217;ll feel good. The drug of accomplishment will flood your brain, making you feel like you progressed towards success.
