**THE SETUP**

That is a stack of World of Warcraft expansion boxes. In fact, it&#8217;s two of each expansion that currently exist. They were installed onto my computer earlier this year. Yesterday, they were all deleted.

Back in February, I got the novel idea to restart my World of Warcraft account (and my wife&#8217;s, too). A few days into some new trial characters led to us both being unhappy with all of the limitations and decided to resurrect our 6 year-old non-trial characters from their grave. She continued one of those characters and I started a new one. We hit 60 soon after and were at a crossroads: no more leveling or content was available in our plain, &#8220;vanilla&#8221; WoW. We needed to pony up some cash to continue the dopamine-rush of new and shiny. Also, we _reaaaaaaally_ wanted flying mounts. Thus, refer to the above picture again.

**THE REALITY**

Getting back into WoW was awesome. So much had changed and it was really fun to get to know something familiar, yet different. Playing an MMO with a partner makes everything more enjoyable. We hacked and slashed and quested our way from 60 to 70 in a couple months. That&#8217;s not impressive compared to the average, but it was the pace that suited us. WoW could definitely feel repetitive, as you do the same kinds of quests in different zones and the same dungeons over and over, but being able to talk with someone else while doing it usually ameliorated the grind.

Then we didn&#8217;t sign in for a few weeks. And that familiar feeling came back: why am I playing this game again?

It&#8217;s simple, though. WoW is a timesink. It&#8217;s not the only kind of timesink there is, but it&#8217;s a popular one. It&#8217;s a carefully orchestrated set of tasks and rewards that string you along, taking your hours and presenting you with numbers that go up and fancy loot to improve your avatar&#8217;s appearance. It&#8217;s a spreadsheet with a chat application covered in fantastical vistas and aggressors with health and mana bars. The more you play, the more you get into it, but also the more you realize it&#8217;s a system that can be predicted and, if you want, perfected. There&#8217;s plenty to do and you&#8217;ll most likely never run out of goals. You just have to put the time into it.

However, after uninstalling it last night and canceling my account for the second time in 7 years, I realized the same thing as before: I&#8217;m tired of what the game has to offer. WoW has a rich backstory, but I don&#8217;t care about it. WoW has millions of people playing it simultaneously, but I don&#8217;t really interact with them. WoW has ultra-high-level dungeons, but I&#8217;m barely interested in getting to them. WoW has PvP, but I suck at it and don&#8217;t want to get better. WoW has a level cap of 85 and I&#8217;m only 70 right now, but the gameplay available to get there is repetitive and largely non-engaging. WoW costs $15/mo to have access to, and I don&#8217;t really want to pay that anymore.

Basically, once again, we&#8217;ve both realized the progress we could make in WoW is more valuable if applied to something else. That&#8217;s it. It doesn&#8217;t mean WoW isn&#8217;t fun or that it was a waste of time to play it. When we played with Josh now and then, the multiplayer aspect of the game was strengthened. Once he moved to Rift, the incentive to play died a little. MMOs are games that feel more important the more people are counting on you to be apart of it. Once the number of people dies down, desire does, as well.

**THE TAKEHOME MESSAGE**

Now that I have stopped investing in WoW, I can focus on programming, which I have started to do in my own time again after a bit of a vacation. I&#8217;m going through [Agile Web Development with Rails (4th Edition)](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails), as suggested by Jimmy, and learning how to create a Ruby on Rails web app. I&#8217;ve dealt with Ruby and Rails tutorials before, so I&#8217;m not going in cold, but I&#8217;ve still never finished my own app from scratch before. The typing/copying code to understanding it ratio is getting a little higher than I&#8217;d like the more I go through the book, but I&#8217;m chalking it up to being horribly rusty. The more apps I make, the better I&#8217;ll understand it.

Also, my hard drive now has 27 additional gigabytes of space.
