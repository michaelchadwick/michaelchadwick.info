I never went to a lot of movies at the theater, but the frequency has only gone down as the years go by. The ability to have a big screen and nice sound system in your living room, as well as many channels of access to the movies themselves, has made paying increasing prices and dealing with sometimes noisy and oftentimes busy movie theaters a deal I do not wish to put up with much anymore. Let&#8217;s sit on the couch and check out NetFlix&#8217;s offerings instead, k?

However, the result of this is that when I _do_ go to the movies, it&#8217;s kind of a special treat. I&#8217;ll be going to **two** movies this week, which is _rare as hell_. Other peeps wanting to go is my main motivation. This odd week of splurging on the theater is spurred on by that very thing.
