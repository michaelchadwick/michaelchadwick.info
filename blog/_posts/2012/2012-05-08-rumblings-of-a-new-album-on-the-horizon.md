Yes, I have another album in mind and in the works (conceptually, at least). Unlike the past few, however, this new album isn&#8217;t going to be new works. Instead, I&#8217;m going to recraft some old ideas (some of which are covers, too) into a single collection. Basically, between the rocking 4-piece instrumental rock stuff and the electronic grooves, I occasionally bust out an acoustic number here and there. I started my compositional hobby with just a single guitar with no accompaniment, and I like to return there now and then.

I&#8217;ve done many recordings of stuff you can play with a single guitar, but the record quality has always been all over the board as my situation and/or gear changed throughout the years. It seems worthy to make a single stop for that kind of music, and it makes even more sense to have them all share a consistent recording quality.

Thus, I&#8217;m going through my archives and picking out some golden oldies from the past (and maybe a few new ones) to give them a more polished treatment. No name has been chosen for this album o&#8217; relaxed stringitude, but that&#8217;s the least of my worries right now: I haven&#8217;t even _tried_ to play some of these pieces in years, so some practice is in order, for sure.
