Apple is doing their WWDC 2012 right now and they just announced their new MBP that is about as thin as an MBA, but also sports a Retina Display (as cheesy as that always sounds, it&#8217;s a good thing), complete with all the top-of-the-line specs you&#8217;d want. It&#8217;s basically an touch-less iPad 3 with a keyboard, but better.

Me wants.

<!--more-->

The standard model is actually not too spendy at **$2200**, and comes with an impressive line-up: quad-core i7 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3D graphics card, USB 3, and 15.4&#8243; screen. 16 months ago I spent $1800 for half the RAM, much less impressive screen/res, a slow 5400 RPM/500 GB HD, thicker body, and a slower CPU. I&#8217;m thinking the heft/chrome reduction and the SSD are worth their weight in gold alone.

Basically, unless they invent something better in the next couple years, this will most likely be my next laptop. The only thing that could make it better is an option for an embedded 1 TB HD for all my samples/installs/data/etc. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m willing to foot an extra $2k for a bigger SSD yet :P
