This is not \*that\* post. You know, the one where I ramble for an incredibly long amount of time about my awesome visit to both London and Paris for a time period equal to about 2 Earth-weeks. No, that will come later.

This post is largely to say that my wife and I are safely back. We survived 2 11-hour plane trips, 2 2.5 hour train rides, and probably about 30 subway rides under and through two busy cities in Europe. All of those trips went pretty well save for the first plane ride from LAX to London. We couldn&#8217;t sleep on the airplane, so leaving at 5:30pm PST and landing at 3:30pm GMT (the next day!) was pretty wacky.

We saw lots of things that tourists saw. We took lots of pictures that tourists take. We ate at lots of places that tourists eat at. We also purchased lots of things that tourists purchase. We were tourists, you know.

I got about 1,000 pictures to sift through, as well as a few videos, so that&#8217;s gonna take a while. I think I&#8217;ll make a silly movie out of them all and write the music for it, too. Cuz that&#8217;s what I do. Robyn will most likely be more efficient than I and just post some highlights, which is all you really want.

It was a culture shock to be there, and it&#8217;s a culture shock to come back. It was totally worth it, though.
