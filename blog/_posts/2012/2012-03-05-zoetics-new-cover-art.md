As mentioned in my previous post, the cover image for _Zoetic_ was hastily thrown together the day of release as I was still waiting for the proper art from a cohort-in-creativity. Well, she finally finished it and it&#8217;s now been uploaded to Bandcamp. Thanks to [Kathy](http://faintidea.net) for the art, yet again (this is her second cover art contribution for me, the first being for my video game remix album, _Gamey Remix_).
