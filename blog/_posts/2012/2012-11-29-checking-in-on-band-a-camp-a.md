Since getting most of my albums up on [Bandcamp](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com) earlier this year, I&#8217;ve checked the stats pretty much every day. BC keeps track of plays (partial and full), &#8220;buzz&#8221; (where people come from), and purchases/downloads. It&#8217;s in a nifty graph and you can see recent, all-time, and many intervals in between. It&#8217;s something I never got around to doing properly when I created a custom place to host my music, so I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re smart and ambitious and can deliver something better than I&#8217;d ever come up with on my own.

I thought I&#8217;d just share some statistics that have been collected over the past 7 or so months since I joined:

* **Plays**
  The top two most-played songs are the first tracks off Impulse (OST) ([12am](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/track/12am)) and Zoetic ([The Jam Bridge](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/track/the-jam-bridge)). They each have about **90** plays, which feels small, but is about 40% higher than the third place spot. Since they&#8217;re the first tracks, it&#8217;s natural they&#8217;d have the most plays: most people never get past the first one. Overall, I&#8217;ve had exactly&#8230;**1,337 plays**. Hax0riffic.
* **Buzz**
  I don&#8217;t advertise too often, and when I do the audience is pretty small and insular. Regardless, my Bandcamp site has been visited **over 4000 times**, with about 65% of those visits being direct links (most likely me linking the site in chat or people just going there cuz I told them about it at some point; it says it doesn&#8217;t track me as long as I log in, which I do most all the time, I swear!).</p>
  I use Twitter and Facebook as my main broadcast medium, but they don&#8217;t seem to result in much follow-through. Either that or Bandcamp is analyzing my stats wrong, or Twitter/FB obfuscate their sources somehow. Leaving a _single comment_ on a post on [tentblogger.com](http://tentblogger.com) actually got me the most views from a single domain source, which kind of blows me away. It&#8217;s all about what has the largest audience! Statistics work.

  For some reason, over the last few months my site has gotten a significant number of hits from .ru websites. Spam? Secretly big in Russia? Not sure.

  * **Sales/Downloads**
    Moving to Bandcamp made it both easier to host and distribute my music. It also added an opportunity to easily _sell_ my wares. Of course, I didn&#8217;t think anybody in this day and age would pay for my stuff since I&#8217;m still mainly unknown, my production is amateurish, and there&#8217;s so much free stuff online that we&#8217;ve devalued music itself. My predictions were pretty much spot-on save for some friend purchases, but every now and then I got surprised by someone spotting me a few bucks (all my albums are now, and have been for a while, pay-what-you-want), which I appreciate.</p>
    In 7 months, with 9 albums to choose from (altho it started at 7), I&#8217;ve had **93 downloads**, 12 of those being purchases. Not enough to pay the bills, but&#8230;well, OK, it&#8217;s really _basically_ nothing. But it&#8217;s not **nothing**. Still, it&#8217;s cool to know and see.

    [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) is awesome. They&#8217;re free and their interface is nice and they have a cool name and the ability to use your own domain. I&#8217;ve found a bunch of interesting bands on there, too, which you can now see [here](http://bandcamp.com/nebyoolae). I highly recommend their whole operation.
