It has been about a year since we brought Penny home. She is 19 months old today. She may not be an actual human child, but she&#8217;s still been the center of our life most of the time. My experience actually having a dependent with wants and needs and quirks has been a storied one, and I&#8217;d like to reflect on it. Others with dogs probably think this is navel-gazing, and those with actual human kids will probably just laugh, but all I know is what my life is and has been. Here&#8217;s how that goes.

## THE GOOD

I want to start off positive, because it&#8217;s always easier to complain. What? A fluffy puppy who is obviously man&#8217;s best friend engenders complaints? Yes, sometimes puppies do that (the younger they are the more often, usually).

However, the good! The good, yes. Penny is very gentle. And she&#8217;s very gracious. Basically, she usually acts dignified, prancing forth like a show dog when at a moderate speed. When she&#8217;s excited or enamored to go someplace for some reason she might drop some of that proper behavior, but it&#8217;s always nice to see her excited about things . She gets compliments on how beautiful she is all the time. Her fur and long nose often take the lion&#8217;s share of these. This means she doesn&#8217;t really like to get dirty or wet which, while limiting some activities, means we have to clean her less often.

She&#8217;s smart and has learned obedience and the ability to respond to commands very well. She often sits, demurely waiting for either attention or treats, rather than constantly bugging or jumping all over you. She&#8217;s cute and soft and enjoys belly rubs.

She&#8217;s never (intentionally) bit anyone and isn&#8217;t aggressive towards other dogs or to humans, and I appreciate that. I always know she&#8217;ll be nice toward strange dogs we happen upon during walks, even if those dogs are not always as socially well-adjusted. It makes me proud of her.

She&#8217;s mostly quiet, as long as she&#8217;s not feeling threatened or hasn&#8217;t heard/or seen something that triggers her fear. She seems to be happy sleeping most of the day, and no longer feels the need to be near us when she does so. It&#8217;s an independence I respect. She also doesn&#8217;t just bark constantly at life for no reason, let alone all night like some dogs do, left alone in a backyard. She doesn&#8217;t really answer other dogs barks with her own.

She makes for a good photo (and video) subject. Much like with a kid, she is essentially the star of many of the photos we took in 2012. I even made a whole video about her, which doesn&#8217;t even include all the videos I recorded at her agility training (which, btw, is pretty cool (and which she is getting quite good at!)).

She likes to go on walks, and we can basically go anywhere, as she doesn&#8217;t balk at much anymore. In fact, despite some mild discontent, she&#8217;ll even trot next to us while we bike places. Getting fresh air is not something I always want to be essentially _forced_ to do, but it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s bad for me, so it&#8217;s a net gain.

All in all, for a first dog (for me), she&#8217;s mostly what I was hoping for and her addition to our lives now feels normal.

## THE BAD

Things start to go south quickly for two primary reasons: fear and unpredictability.

Full disclosure: we got Penny from a breeder who lives in a rural area. This breeder lived alone with about a dozen adult dogs, and the 10 or so puppies in the litter we acquired Penny herself from. Her environment was essentially that: one human, many dogs, desert, and&#8230;not much else that we know of. For Penny&#8217;s first 6 months, that was kind of it.

Bringing her to The Big City (comparatively) was a big culture shock. Cars, planes, other humans, kitchen appliances, garage doors, friends with small children, and all other manner of city life were essentially new to her. In the first half of the first year we&#8217;ve had her, she lived in fear, largely quietly. In the second half of the first year we&#8217;ve had her, she&#8217;s lived in less fear, but she&#8217;s far more vocal about it now. Yes, that quiet, little scared puppy who didn&#8217;t even want to go up or down our stairs, let alone on a walk around our neighborhood, turned into a dog much more confident of her surroundings, but still afraid of many things, and now with no shame about barking at any and all of it if the urge arises.

I do want to preface the rest of this with an observation: Penny tends to be the worst of Robyn&#8217;s and my own anxieties. I see both of us in her behavior, but only more immature and with less restraint. You know, like a dog (or any other creature without an ego and superego) might handle it. It&#8217;s almost like dealing with a furry version of ourselves, which is not necessarily easy all the time.

In general, Penny tends to respond to new stimuli (or even **pre-existing stimuli** sometimes!) with fear instead of curiosity. The thing is, it&#8217;s sometimes expected, but also sometimes completely unpredictable. The things we&#8217;re fairly sure she&#8217;ll always hate are garbage trucks and people appearing out of nowhere, especially with non-standard visual elements (cast, carrying something, holding a kid on their shoulders, etc.). Decorations on houses in our neighborhood are a mixed bag, as sometimes she&#8217;ll let them go, and other times she&#8217;ll bark at them. While inside the house, she&#8217;s pretty quiet, but hearing people or things outside will prompt her voice, even if she&#8217;s tired and looks like she&#8217;s sleeping! Her bark is often sudden and loud/piercing, so while we&#8217;ve grown more accustomed to it over time, the contrast between silence and her on high alert is jarring, unpleasant, and can send us both into a tailspin, especially if others are around and we&#8217;re trying toÂ _avoid_ being a nuisance.

Penny tends to be cool with routine and now expects certain things like walks and treats at the same time each day, which is fine, but it also makes you wish she would just &#8220;chill out&#8221; and leave you alone sometimes. Her bathroom routine is also fairly unpredictable as she can change up her habits and where she&#8217;s OK with going regularly. When you&#8217;re trying to leave for work or just want to go to bed (we don&#8217;t have a backyard and have to take her out every time), it can be frustrating. Her digestive system has been awry several times since we&#8217;ve gotten her, prompting unexpected doctor bills for tests that proved that nothing was wrong with her :-\

Another unpredictable thing that is just confounding much of the time is her seeming lack of interest in toys, food, and playing with most other dogs. We thought she was a dog-dog, but she&#8217;s become an us-dog. I don&#8217;t want to mislead or anything, as she&#8217;s definitely still interested in other dogs, but interest in playing with them is much more inconsistent.

During her several hour energetic stretch each night (where she becomes much more insistent on interaction with us or somebody) and right after we return home from being gone, she might chew on something, or fetch something, or chase after us. She seems to store up this energy each time and then need to release it. Otherwise, toys are almost non-existent to her. Each meal is a crapshoot, as she will often just ignore food. Treats and people food, though? Those are always interesting and worth a small amount of begging. She&#8217;s largely skin and bones because of this, though, which concerns, but doesn&#8217;t worry us.

Overall, her quirks confuse me, and her annoyances frustrate me. An animal sitting politely, but just staring at you, and you not knowing what they want, can be kind of unnerving! Her behaviors have gotten easier to handle with time and experience, but she can still cause both Robyn and I to fret when she&#8217;s not eating or ignoring our attempts to entice her with toys, and also to want to murder her when she&#8217;s misbehaving, especially when it&#8217;s totally irrational and we just want her to be good and quiet.

## THE FUZZY

The &#8220;bad&#8221; section of this is somewhat longer, I know. Like I said, it&#8217;s easier to criticize than it is to praise. Getting a pet was a risk, as anything new is. You can only be so sure of the personality of the dog, and that can change over time, too. Knowing what we know now, maybe we would&#8217;ve been more cautious getting a dog from a place that was so different from our own environment. We often joke that while Penny is not a &#8220;rescue&#8221;, per se, it feels like we &#8220;rescued&#8221; her from the desert.

Having to board her when we&#8217;re not around is money we&#8217;d rather not spend, but at least she seems to enjoy where we take her, and she&#8217;s usually good and tired that evening so we can have some time to just relax and not have to come up with the energy to entertain her.

That&#8217;s kind of the routine: do what we can to regularly get her some exercise, entertain her when she&#8217;s insistent on interaction, and make sure she&#8217;s at least fed and has an opportunity to go to the bathroom every now and then. As long as we do that, she&#8217;s pretty content and independent and we can relax and enjoy her company. I&#8217;m still anxious sometimes when our routine changes and we don&#8217;t necessarily have the time or ability to give her the exercise or interaction I think she needs. My irrational fear is she&#8217;ll wake us up in the middle of the night (instead of sometime between 5:45 and 6:30am, as is her usual awakening time) and be inconsolable, or that she&#8217;ll go to the bathroom in the house while we&#8217;re gone or asleep. Except for a handful of rare exceptions, she&#8217;s been perfect, maintaining her composure for far longer than I thought she would. I have to give her props for that.

## FOR THE ROAD

Penny is pretty awesome. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can always entirely relax around her, or that she doesn&#8217;t do things that frustrate or annoy us. She&#8217;s just the way she is, and the bad things always eventually end and give way to the good things. We spent a lot of time and money and enlisted training and help along the way to get her to where she is now, and it was worth it. I&#8217;m always gonna expect the best out of her and feel somewhat disappointed when she gives in to the fear and starts becoming a nuisance. I can&#8217;t control that about her, though, so I try to just become at peace with it instead.

The change of going from no pet for basically my entire life to taking care of one with my wife has been one long exercise in learning to accept change and come to peach with it. I&#8217;m still working on it, but I&#8217;m getting there.
