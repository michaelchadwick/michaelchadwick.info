**AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR**

General status level: good. Also, Happy Birthday to anyone who is celebrating today. With ~7 billion people in the world, many of you probably are.

**FAMILY**

We&#8217;ve had our rough collie, Penny, for over 2 months now. We haven&#8217;t taken her back this time, so things are going well, I guess. The lowest moment so far, besides the (still present) anxiety of moving from crating her every night to sleeping in our room, was when we met with an animal behaviorist. Penny is still not crazy about going outside and can be anywhere from concerning to exasperating depending on our current mental state. A neighbor recommended someone to us and we finally took her up on the suggestion.

At the end of a 2+ hour consultation, the behaviorist seemed quite worried and gave us a few options:

  1. Get a more confident dog to act as a &#8220;service dog&#8221; for Penny, since she seems to follow other dogs for leadership when outside more than she follows us
  2. Allow the behaviorist to take her to her ranch and do intensive flooding training, so as to continuously expose her to new environments, in the hopes that she&#8217;ll become less scared
  3. Get rid of her :(

Obviously, she hesitantly brought up the last option, as it&#8217;s the most emotional. Still, the fact that she thought the training needed to &#8220;fix&#8221; our dog was probably outside our grasp due to our work/lifestyle was pretty sobering.

It&#8217;s been almost two weeks since our meeting with her and we&#8217;ve only decided on nixing 1 and 3. We&#8217;ve vacillated on 2 the whole time. Sure, it will probably help her, but it&#8217;s a big commitment, both emotionally and financially. And when she returns we&#8217;d have special training we&#8217;d need to do and get her other handlers (parents, dogsitters) to follow. It&#8217;s a lot to take in for someone who&#8217;s never had a dog before!

In the last week, however, I&#8217;ve walked her home from a dog park, and walked her to a major shopping center and back, with only sporadic trouble (pulling, spooking, etc.). In other words, with a little confidence in myself to be the leader and control her better, things are looking up. She&#8217;s still not exactly happy to be outside and I&#8217;m sure intensive training would help alleviate it, but I feel like by just being confident with her she mirrors my energy.

In other words, we haven&#8217;t made any decision on what we&#8217;re going to do, but we&#8217;ll both keep trying for now. Having a dog around the house is still somewhat weird, in that this &#8220;presence&#8221; is constantly around, being somewhat unpredictable. Everyday is a little better, but it&#8217;s hard to say whether I&#8217;ll ever be 100% fine with it.

**READING**

I read the [Steve Jobs biography](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537) and enjoyed it. The criticism that it doesn&#8217;t always paint an in-depth picture of Jobs, but instead merely reports it, is somewhat valid. You see the good and the bad of Steve, but you never really know why. Even when pressed, he doesn&#8217;t articulate why he can be such an asshole, or why he felt that was the only way to get people to do great things. He controlled through fear instead of love, I guess. It was a great History of Apple at the very least.

Robyn started reading the [Ender&#8217;s Game](http://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Book-1/dp/0812550706/) series at my behest and apparently loves it! This is surprising, but awesome. I got her all of the initial quartology for our anniversary, so she should be good for awhile.

**ANNIVERSARY**

Speaking of which, Robyn and I celebrated 2 years happily married last Monday. For lunch, we went to the [Seaside forum](http://sio.ucsd.edu/About/Venue_Rentals/Scripps_Forum/Galleries/), just as planned. We went to the new cafe on the second floor, which was just an empty construction hazard when we got married there. Both of us had very interesting sandwiches, she a butternut squash pannini, and I a tuna melt with red onions and carrots in the mix. For dinner, we hit up the [94th Aero Squadron](http://www.the94thaerosquadron.com/), mainly because the 5 restaurants we tried before it were all closed on Monday evening (wtf?!). We had a nice, low-key meal while watching some ducks near the airport waddle around. I love her very much and am so glad to spend my life with her.

**GAMING**

The last major game I played and finished was [Dead Island](http://www.deadislandgame.com), a really engaging and visceral zombie eviscerating simulation that takes place on an infested land mass surrounded by water. I actually got really sick (food poisoning or flu, not sure) over the holidays and was playing it at the same time, making it all the more real. I did not eat anyone&#8217;s brain, however.

Long-form gaming is in the guise of [Deus Ex: Human Revolution](http://deusex.com/). I waited a while for this to get cheap, but it&#8217;s worth full price. The MGS-style gameplay is fun and it&#8217;s rad to sneak around enemy encampments and try not to rambo it up. It&#8217;s a little choppy on my 2011 MBP, which detracts from the flow a bit, but still doable. Short-form gaming (the chaser, as it were) is Dustforce. Think Super Meat Boy, but with less emphasis on barely beating the level and instead more emphasis on beating the level _with style_. It&#8217;s a bit on the punishing side of the difficulty scale because it forces you to get reaaaally good at a few initial levels before opening up subsequent ones, but the gameplay (with a controller) is fun and almost Sonic or Tony Hawk in nature with its never-ending (if you&#8217;re good) combo mechanic.

On the iOS front, [Hero Academy](http://www.robotentertainment.com/games/heroacademy) is devouring my soul. Take Dungeon Defender&#8217;s crystal guarding and add in a chess-like tactical game mechanic and you&#8217;ve got something I&#8217;m constantly checking on my phone. I&#8217;m so addicted I&#8217;ve got about 10 games going right now, half or more with random strangers. Asynchronous multiplayer on a portable device is perfect for my gaming style.

As far as board gaming goes, my friend Jawn came down from NorCal for a weekend and brought several from his ever-burgeoning collection. The main event was surely [Eclipse](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse), an epic space war. It took us about ~5 hours to get through it, which was about 1 hour per person, plus an hour of explanation. Games like this are experiences for me, meaning it&#8217;s fun to do once, but the thought of spending so much time on one game again feels kinda rough. Any game that complicated and with a million pieces to keep track of feels like it would work better as a video game. Still, hanging out with friends is paramount, so I&#8217;ll do it again if it comes up.

**PROGRAMMING**

The desire to do any programming that isn&#8217;t required by work is currently dead, just like it&#8217;s been for a while now. I have no idea when it will come back.

**MUSICAL**

December and January have not been productive, compositionally or recordingly. To be honest, having a puppy around takes up a lot of my time and mental space, leaving little for musical ambition. Penny seems pretty sensitive to music/sound and the one time I played guitar she actually growled and barked at me! Maybe she can get more comfortable if I play more, but I haven&#8217;t been in the mood to test the waters. I believe I&#8217;m going to make a more concerted effort in February (at least on the weekends) to try and get her used to it, but that remains to be seen.

One way or another, I&#8217;m going to be releasing the soundtrack to the indie game I scored last year in March 2012. I need to polish some stuff before saying it&#8217;s &#8220;done&#8221;, but for the most part it&#8217;s pretty solid (in my mind, at least). Look for it for cheap on Bandcamp around about then.

**FOR THE ROAD**

I began a massive decluttering of stuff in the music room downstairs recently. There&#8217;s junk all over the place as I reorganize and rid myself of things I&#8217;ve been keeping and moving from place to place for no real reason besides packratdom. How many black, grounded power cables does one person really need, anyway? And yet, it&#8217;s hard to just throw something away when I could put it in a container, all nicely zip-tied up. This is the disease, people. Learn to fight it! Keep only what you need, not what you think you&#8217;ll need some day in the year 6545 when you&#8217;re DEAD.
