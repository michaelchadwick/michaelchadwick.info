<p>So, it's been a looooooong time since I did any personal dev stuff. I used to spend a lot of time on web apps, making my own blogs and music database systems and the like. Somewhere down the line I just kind of...completely lost interest in maintaining any of it, let alone making new stuff.</p>

<p>So I dropped it all.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My main website, <a href="https://nebyoolae.com">nebyoolae.com</a>, just links to my Bandcamp, because, well, they do it better than me! It also got me to prune my collection of music from "everything" to "the things worth sharing". My web dev marketing site, <a href="http://nebyooweb.com">nebyooweb.com</a>, hasn't been updated in a long time. In fact, I'm actually really horrible at and uninterested in marketing myself (and I got a job already), so its purpose in existing is negligible at best right now. All my other little mini-projects and subdomains were fun to play around with at the time, but don't need any attention anymore. In the end, I just kind of gave up on trying and focused on the .NET stuff I do at work, but not doing anything in my spare time.</p>

<p>However!</p>

<p>I'm starting anew. My deleted Github account has been resurrected and changed to my <a href="https://github.com/michaelchadwick">actual name</a>. It's probably a good thing to separate my musical/general Internet persona of "nebyoolae" from my professional, real-name persona, anyway. Anything I create will eventually go on here, for better or worse. Part of getting better is admitting your mistakes and defeats, and seeing yourself grow. This is really hard for me, because I'd much rather just hide all my crappy code and/or give up. It's really difficult to admit I'm not good and accept help in order to get better. Also, doing things other people have done a million times before is OK, because you need to have the experience of doing it yourself.</p>

<p>That all being said, here is a list of things I'm going to try out (eventually):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple blog in Rails</li>
  <li>jQuery plugin design</li>
  <li>Python scripting (and maybe django for a simple blog)</li>
  <li>HTML5/CSS3/responsive design</li>
  <li>Flash Actionscript (simple game)</li>
  <li>Adobe Air (Twitter client?)</li>
  <li>iOS app</li>
  <li>Chrome extension</li>
  <li>Database design (this is something I often struggle with)</li>
  <li>Simple Ruby command line script</li>
</ul>

<p>That's a big list, I know. I don't pretend to guarantee I'll get to all of it, but it's what I'm currently interested in. Gotta start with some ideas.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, all the code will be open-sourced on Github, but I will try to blog about it at <a href="https://codaname.neb.host">codaname</a>, my new coding site (which will most likely be the simple blog in Rails). It's barren now, but soon it will had links to stuff. Yes...links.</p>
