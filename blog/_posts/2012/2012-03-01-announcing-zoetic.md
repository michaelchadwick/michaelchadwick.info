Introducing _Zoetic_, now available at [Bandcamp](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/zoetic)!

About 10 years ago I created my first &#8220;real&#8221; album of original music. It was called _Clocks Striking 13_. No, it wasn&#8217;t an ode to _1984_, as I had actually forgotten about that reference at the time. I really just thought it looked cool, and gave me a good visual to base a cover off of.

_CS13_ was just a bunch of actual, fully-realized instrumental rock compositions I&#8217;d cobbled together over the years and then was able to record and mix together in a month. I created it in Cakewalk Guitar Tracks 2 on a Windows XP machine, using a limited amount of drum loops and a cheap microphone to capture some live guitar. Bass was handled by recording guitar and then EQing it. The albums sounds pretty dated now, but I&#8217;m still proud that I pulled it off.

Fast-forward to August 2011. I&#8217;ve got quite a few more guitars, basses, and other musical playthings. I&#8217;m much more of a one-man band now. I use a Mac primarily, and my sequencer of choice is Logic. I&#8217;ve bought several sample packs and have a couple MIDI controllers for input. A nice multi-input audio interface sits under my LCD monitor and some large audio monitors festoon the sides of my desk, ready for output. A lot has changed in 10 years.

The beginning of _Zoetic_ began like lots of other projects: my thoughts coalesce into a single vision at some point, and I realize I have a few sketches or ideas between the new things I&#8217;ve recorded here and there for fun and some failed projects of yesteryear. I think to myself, &#8220;I might have something here. I might have an album.&#8221; And thus a Google Doc detailing a tracklist is born.

My initial idea for the album was going to include some electronic or experimental stuff alongside the usual instrumental rock that my brain constantly develops. However, I ran into some creative trouble on anything that wasn&#8217;t my stock guitar/bass/drums combination, so those ideas either went to the Impulse (OST) or to the digital archive bin. Over the next 7 months, tracks got cut or added at my whim, finally ending up at that magical number **11**. The garageband that is me in a room with some guitars, mics, and a sequencer chock full o&#8217; samples was all I needed. Except for a few samples here and there (and the drums, obv), _Zoetic_ is all me.

And it&#8217;s available on [Bandcamp](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/zoetic).

You could say that this is a post-neo-grunge album, minus lyrics, but sprinkled with vocals. I don&#8217;t often sing, and I rarely write lyrics, but I really felt like adding some vocal accompaniment was needed for this project. Thus, I dug into my reserves and found some vocal samples here and there that seemed to sweeten the mix. &#8220;New Settlement&#8221; probably uses them the best, actually seeming like a melody that goes along with the music, and not just padding. Initially, I had no vocals at all, but since adding them, I can&#8217;t imagine these pieces without them.

One last thing: much like my soundtrack for Impulse, I&#8217;m putting [_Zoetic_](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/zoetic)up for actual money. I usually think that my music isn&#8217;t worth anything, but I&#8217;ve come to feel like that&#8217;s the wrong attitude. For people to take you seriously, you must first take yourself seriously. I&#8217;m going to start that by putting a nominal fee on the downloads of any album I make that ends up at [Bandcamp](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com). Anything else that is more of a &#8220;single&#8221; or throwaway idea that&#8217;s still worth sharing will go to [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/nebyoolae) for free listening/downloading. My personal site at [nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com) will soon just be a jumping off point for these services, and I won&#8217;t be hosting every single song I have like I&#8217;ve been doing for years. BC and SC do their respective jobs better than I could ever do, and I&#8217;m gonna start supporting that.

In sum, go and enjoy the music I have made. I hope you do.
