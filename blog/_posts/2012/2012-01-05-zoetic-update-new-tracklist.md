I keep toying with some of the track names on my upcoming instrumental rock album _Zoetic_. Some names just seem right from the get go and others never quite seem right, changing a lot in the process as I listen and work on them. All-instrumental albums are like that: fluid until the time I call it &#8220;done&#8221;.

On the whole, it&#8217;s changed significantly since [last time]({{ site.baseurl }}/2011/08/22/nebyoolaeous-experience-album-update/ "Zoetic (formerly The Nebyoolaeous Experience) Tracklist"). A few songs got name changes and a few even got lopped right off. They didn&#8217;t actually get removed, but instead repurposed, something I do quite a lot. Other projects come up that need inspiration, or a song doesn&#8217;t work within the overall context of the album, so it gets stripped off as a single. When you write music so haphazardly, these kinds of things will happen.

A nice solid ten tunes for one album always feels nice, even if one of them is kind of a cutesy &#8220;throwaway&#8221;. I still enjoy listening to the rough drafts, even after repeated listenings, which means that _Zoetic_ is pretty solid. Jamming a couple of them with friends worked out well, so I think I got something good here. There&#8217;s always parts here and there that I need to improve, which I will&#8230;eventually. Mixing and mastering is a pain for me, too. I hope to get it polished off to a tasteful shimmer before mid-March.
