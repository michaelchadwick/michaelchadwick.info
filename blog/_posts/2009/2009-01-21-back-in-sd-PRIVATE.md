We actually got back in on Monday, January 19, but I just got around to typing this out today, two days later. Boy howdy, that was some incredibly banal information!

This is not the actual LJ post where I describe our awesome trip. That will come later. This post is solely to say Robyn, her dad, and her grandma (as well as me, of course) are back in our home bases. Robyn&#8217;s mom and brother are still in DC, living it up during the pre-, during-, and post-inauguration festivities. They will return to their points of origin this coming weekend.

Work is busy, so I&#8217;s best get back to it.
