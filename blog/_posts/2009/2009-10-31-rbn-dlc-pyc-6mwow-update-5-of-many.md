It&#8217;s been a while, everybody, but I finally got back on track with everything.

Tonight has been quite productive! I got all the Bass charts done, as well as the animation for the drums, and some decent overdrive/fill spots for all the instruments. The animation for guitar/bass, as well as lighting/camera cues, are not done, but I&#8217;m thinking I might try running this thing without them, just to see if the thing works.

Before I can go alpha with it (otherwise known as uploading it for the first time to my Xbox 360), however, I&#8217;ll need to get the lyrics in, and I was having some trouble getting them imported correctly (the text file isn&#8217;t quite right), so that&#8217;ll take a little bit more effort.

For tonight, I think I&#8217;m spent, so it&#8217;ll have to wait until Next Time&#8230;whenever that may be :-D
