After Kotaku slammed my server for a while, my webhost finally got around to noticing that 95% of the files in my account were MP3s of large size. They suspended me, naturally. In other words, I got Kotaku&#8217;d/Slashdotted/Dugg/etcetera&#8217;d!

<!--more-->

_As cool as that is_, it **sucks** because I essentially had to gut my site in order to get them to re-enable my account. I did some housecleaning and it&#8217;s back up with a blog post announcing that I&#8217;m on Kotaku.

During the redesign I initially thought I was gonna keep the &#8220;put all my music online and then only highlight some of it to visitors&#8221; idea going for my website, but now that I can&#8217;t keep so many files online (which is ideally where I&#8217;d like them), I&#8217;m just gonna be pickier about what I post. Right now, [Ebben Flow](http://ef.nebyoolae.com) is the only thing anyone cares about, so that&#8217;s the only thing up (besides some files of me playing guitar on the [demo](http://demo.nebyoolae.com) site). It&#8217;s probably a good way, organizationally, to think about my music, because I have attachment and packrat issues with keeping everything I&#8217;ve ever done within reach from anywhere, even if it&#8217;s not that good. This thins out the advancing hordes that are my prolificness.

Anyway, it&#8217;s **fucking unbelievable** that I got on a popular gaming blog and that, except for a few thousand who got there after the site went down, 10,000+ people viewed the story and some subset went on to my site and saw shit that&#8217;s been up there for months, languishing. New life was breathed into it, and maybe the next time I do something Internet-worthy I&#8217;ll be remembered since I already got at least one nod.

Also, I shopped the story to a few more sites and still waiting on a few I had already submitted to, so maybe there will be a resurgence&#8230;but most likely yesterday was the pinnacle. Gotta take it where I can get it.
