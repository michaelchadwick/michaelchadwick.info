The new iPhone 3.0 software is sweet. It&#8217;s got tons of updates and refinements and new features.

Notables: cut/copy/paste support, MMS, more landscape keyboard mode support, iPod/Contacts/Calendar/Apps search, and a bunch of others.

It isn&#8217;t available until the summer, but the new SDK (which has also been massively updated) is available today for people who want to take advantage of it. I&#8217;m an idiot when it comes to programming for anything Mac, so it&#8217;s useless to me, but others will surely devour it.

Sw00t.
