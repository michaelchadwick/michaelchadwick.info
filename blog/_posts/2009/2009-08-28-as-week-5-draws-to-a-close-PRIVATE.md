The thing foremost in my mind, perhaps to the detriment of everything else, is my new job. I&#8217;m coming to the end of week 5 here and I&#8217;d like to make a few observations.

<!--more-->

**OBSERVATION, THE FIRST**
In general, things are going well. I feel comfortable despite working in a shared office where a (kinda) supervisor can see my screen(s) at any time. I feel comfortable in my commute. I feel comfortable in the work I&#8217;m doing.

More specifically, the work itself, so far, is about the same as at any web design job I&#8217;ve ever had, that being updating a website&#8217;s content, design, and functionality. The main difference is that I&#8217;m getting paid more than I ever have before to do it. Oh, and all my development is in .NET for the first time, even if I&#8217;m not really using it to its full potential yet.

**OBSERVATION, THE SECOND**
The office I work in reminds me of the last UCSD job I had. Instead of being on campus, I&#8217;m surrounded by hospitals and hospital-related buildings. Offices are offices, but unlike my last job where there was a whopping FOUR of us at work on any average day, there are just more people now, and more of everything else. Lots of people, lots of departments, lots of projects, and lots of meetings.

My day, except for a weekly meeting on Tuesday, is spent in front of a computer with a break for lunch (that has been often spent in the same place). I know a lot of people hear that and wince or groan, but I&#8217;m comfortable here, at the keyboard and mouse, with the Internet and some development tools at my disposal. Everyone else seems to be constantly hither and thither, with people walking down the hallway, doors opening and closing, and phone and in-person conversations going on all the time. I feel like my &#8220;space&#8221; is somewhat excluded from this, even though I&#8217;m right in the line of sight with the main avenue of traffic, and that&#8217;s fine by me.

**OBSERVATION, THE THIRD**
With the mixed-purpose office environment and mentality comes some downsides. There seem to be multiple purposes and agendas floating around, and I, being new and a temp, don&#8217;t really feel obligated to participate in choosing any sides, despite being in a shared office that most likely lies on one side of any eventual debate. The more people ultimately responsible for a project, the more potential conflicts and waiting that arises, possibly derailing its completion. My office mate has plenty of projects that are not done yet, and may never be done, depending on other people. My current project, that of the website, feels like it could be completed in due time, but each meeting brings more changes and possible additions that push the deadline back. In other words, as with all websites, it&#8217;ll be in flux forever. Job security, I suppose!

Additionally, the other temp and I who were brought on seem to be technically-oriented in a way that isn&#8217;t shared by a large majority of our co-workers, putting us in the &#8220;smart computer guy&#8221; category again, as opposed to an equal playing field. I don&#8217;t really like feeling that way anymore, but it&#8217;s easy ego-boosting, at the expense of real intellectual growth not brought on by myself (which can be flaky).

**FOR THE ROAD**
In conclusion, I am lucky to have a cushy tech job again. Leaving my last job was necessary due to forced furloughs, lagging technological growth, and lack of advancement potential. This job has a lot more to offer and is both comfortable and full-time, perfect for low levels of stress and the ability to save for the future. My temperament makes giving up shorts, sandals, and my own office for slacks, shoes, and a shared office with no windows doable, if not preferable. It&#8217;s too early to tell where I&#8217;ll go here, if anywhere beyond my carved-out niche, but I look forward to finding out.
