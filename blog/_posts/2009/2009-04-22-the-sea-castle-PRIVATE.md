I provided the soundtrack to my fiance&eacute;'s 2+ year-long picture-taking project of the building of the new Scripps Seaside Forum . It's entitled &#8220;The Sea Castle&#8221; and can be found in two places.

1) [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/3923846)
2) [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btYKAvGp78A)

I urge you to check one or the other out and leave a comment.
