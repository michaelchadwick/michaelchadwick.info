For most of you, it&#8217;s probably no surprise that most of my random thoughts that would go here now go to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nebyoolae). Journaling the day&#8217;s happenings in 140-character chunks rather than the several-paragraph-LJ-post works better. I don&#8217;t believe Twitter will ever actually kill my desire to LJ, mainly because I like having no (discernible) limit on a certain encapsulation of my psyche and the archival system is much better. Still, I don&#8217;t see making nearly the same number of posts as I&#8217;ve done in the past.

**OPEN-MIC**
I suppose it&#8217;s appropriate that Kathy emailed me a few days ago, asking to hang out, and that we ended up going to Jyothi-Bihanga, and then later Lestat&#8217;s for coffee and open-mic. It was [exactly two years before](http://nebyoolae.livejournal.com/455477.html) that we played our first non-open-mic show at Twigg&#8217;s Green Room on Groundhog&#8217;s Day 2007. That was an amazing night full of friends and music, and I remember it fondly. Lestat&#8217;s has since lost Isaac, their joyously cool host to the Down Underness of Australia, and the new guy is just not as good. We stayed for a while, listening to a lot of good acts, as well as one duo who did a stirring rendition of &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; There was one meh act that was followed by an intriguing lass who sang about being against slavery and actually being a healthy Jew. Open-mic, man! You never know what you&#8217;ll get.

Thinking about my life in a gigging acoustic pop duo for a while, it was a pretty sweet life. For once, the musical part of me didn&#8217;t need to be ashamed. I could tell people I was in a band, that we played publicly, and that we were recording an album. People asked me how the album was going, when our next gig was, and that they liked our music. I got to actively, and consistently, share my love of writing and playing music with someone else. The brouhaha about [Ebben Flow](http://nebyoolae.livejournal.com/556056.html) has been awesome, and reminiscent in a lesser way, but it&#8217;s not the same. I miss it.

**AVERAGE TOWN**
Chiptune music is like the classic rock station to me, only I was alive when it was all getting written. Nostalgia and simple, catchy beats composed of simple waveforms and shaped white noise continue to amuse me even today. Thus, writing some of it is a natural experiment for me to embark on. It&#8217;s not done yet, but a 5-track EP entitled _Average Town_ is coming your way soon. STAY TUNED.

**FOR THE ROAD**
Diabolus Americanus.
