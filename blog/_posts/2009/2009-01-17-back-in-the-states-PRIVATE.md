After an awesome Air France flight from Paris to DC, we are back in the states. Staying with Robyn&#8217;s cousin who works for the gubment. Gonna see some monuments soon, hopefully. Long vacation is almost over.

Cruise was awesome, all blogged in the leather-bound journal I got 4-5 years ago, but there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m transcribing it all on LJ. Thus, you&#8217;ll get a summary post later, and details in-person.

It&#8217;s currently in the teens temperature-wise here in DC. Time to layer.
