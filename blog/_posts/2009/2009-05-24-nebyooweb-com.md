Nebyooweb is live! Just point your browser to <http://nebyooweb.com> and feast your eyes on what I&#8217;ve done.

<!--more-->

The point of Nebyooweb.com (as an entity apart from Nebyoolae.com) is to showcase my web design skills. My aim is to it to some more job opportunities, and hopefully I&#8217;ll snag a full-time coding job. I may not be good enough yet, but I&#8217;m gonna give it a go. I&#8217;ve been making websites for a long time and I&#8217;m ready to become more than a hobbyist. I&#8217;d like to make it my career, if possible.

To build Nebyooweb, I learned a framework called [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org), a Javascript framework called [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and brushed up on both Ajax and MySQL. I was (still am) rusty, and learning all the new stuff on top of remembering the old stuff was a feat (and continues to be!). The technologies related, be they markup, programming, or frameworks, all fascinate me as much as they frustrate me, so to say the past few weeks have been, at times, hellish, is about right. My temperament does not a patient learner make and I was about to give up at many points. Thankfully, due to **a lot** of help from [perceptes](http://perceptes.livejournal.com/){.lj-user} (which has included weekly programming help sessions), I&#8217;ve finished, save for adding potential features later.

In the meantime, I&#8217;m recoding Nebyoolae.com, which will now be solely focused on music. I&#8217;m putting it through the Cake oven, as well, since it really does make a database-driven website much easier to get up and running.

Feel free to go, check it out, mess with stuff, and tell me what works and what doesn&#8217;t.
