OMFG! I got it to build! I got to build!

To make this sensible to non-people-who-have-been-working-on-a-piece-of-RB-DLC-for-several-weeks, I&#8217;ll say that the program that compiles all the audio and MIDI together finally got through its compilation with no errors.

<!--more-->

I spent about an hour tonight trying to fix its (sometimes perplexing) error messages and was about to give up. I had it down to one left, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what was causing it. I shut down my VM with XP in it (I use Reaper on a MacBook for all the sequencing of audio and MIDI and Magma, the RB DLC "authoring" tool, in Windows cuz it don&#8217;t got a Mac version), ready to call it a day, when I looked at Reaper, thought about the error, and then made a change which I was fairly sure was going to make everything all better. Fired up the VM again, fired up Magma, crossed my fingers, and BAM! No errors.

All that&#8217;s left now is for me to either pay $50 for 4 months or $100 for 12 months of FULL-ON Microsoft XNA membership, necessary for uploading my finished bundle to my 360. I figured if I actually paid it tonight and it uploaded successfully, I&#8217;d be up ALL night playing and tweaking it, so I&#8217;m gonna hold off. But, damn, man. It&#8217;s gonna work. It&#8217;s just a bunch of playtesting and customizing from here on out.

Pure Yellow Colour WILL be on Rock Band&#8230;**soon**.
