Another late night, another PYC RBN update.

Tonight I tackled the guitar charts. I had already written a decent Expert chart, but it needed quite a bit of tweaking, mainly to make it flow better and to make sustained notes make more sense. Despite playing a LOT of Rock Band and Guitar Hero, there&#8217;s still some difficulty in making your own note charts to spec, no matter how many you&#8217;ve played.

<!--more-->

The process of stripping away notes to go from a higher difficulty to a lower one is as about as straightforward on guitar as it is on drums, with the somewhat more heinous modifier of having potential note positions disappear on Medium and Easy. A good familiarity with the source music is key to knowing where you can eliminate notes without sacrificing rhythmic stability. Still, I&#8217;m not used to playing anything below Expert anymore, so the charts for the other three are crap shoots. Much actual playtesting is needed.

Tomorrow (or whenever I next work on it): charting the bass for Hard, Medium, and Easy, as well cleaning up Expert a bit.
