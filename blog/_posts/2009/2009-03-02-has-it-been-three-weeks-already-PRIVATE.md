Has it really been three weeks since I released Average Town?

<!--more-->

**NEAR-TOP OF THE AFTERNOON**
It has been three weeks since I &#8220;released&#8221; [Average Town](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/view/7) here on the ol&#8217; LJ and the response has been underwhelming. Oh well. Time to move on to bigger and better things. Like, for instance, what I&#8217;ve been up to for the past 21 days.

**GOOGLE SYNC <-> GOOGLE SYNC**
I started using [Google Sync](http://www.google.com/mobile/default/sync.html), the service which (currently) syncs your Google Contacts (in Gmail) and Google Calendar with your mobile device (i.e. my iPhone). Make a change on one and the other updates. Pretty slick, although I make changes really infrequently in both camps, so the _magic_ doesn&#8217;t happen very often.

**DER WORDLE**
Speaking of iPhones, I&#8217;ve been playing a Text/Word Twist variant called [Wordle](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=293984338&mt=8) (opens iTunes) lately, and it&#8217;s really fun. Fun, as in as fun as the other 445346562636 apps elsewhere that do the same kind of anagram-based puzzle action. It&#8217;s a very polished app, tho and it interacts directly with Facebook so you can see others&#8217; scores. So far, only Jimmy and I have any ranked scores, so I encourage you to **word up** and see if you can beat us.

**ANOTHER LAYER IN MY MUSICAL IDENTITY**
My music at work as of late has been cycling through a few video game soundtracks over and over. Namely, the [World of Goo](http://2dboy.com/2009/01/20/world-of-goo-soundtrack-now-available-for-download/) (yummy orchestral/electronic), [Quest for Glory II](http://www.queststudios.com/quest/qfg2vga/qfg2vga.html) (old-school, MIDI-ish) and Painkiller (heavy metal instrumental) OSTs. Both are really good for very different reasons. Both seem to placate my entire desire to interact with them in any capacity simply by listening to the music featured therein. In fact, I don&#8217;t even feel the need to play the games the music goes behind! I am weird.

**FRIENDSPACE**
According to Google Calendar, which is really the only other way I can remember any events that have transpired if I don&#8217;t LJ them, I&#8217;ve had dinner with Chazzica, been to a child&#8217;s birthday party, eaten pancakes for dinner, consumed jambalaya and king cake, programmed Objective-C at Jimmy&#8217;s, and gone to a quiz night at a local pub, all on different days, and all in the last 3 weeks. Wow! I am social.

**AHKOOSTIK BASS**
Costco rebates are a great thing. You use your Amex card all year to buy stuff like you normally would, but at the end of the year you get a small percentage back. Between the two of us, Robyoolae was able to combine financial forces and finally finagle an [acoustic bass](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Laguna-LAB5CE-Acoustic-Electric-Bass-104847439-i1403500.gc) from Guitar Center.

To summarize, our house now has an acoustic guitar, an acoustic-electic guitar, an electric guitar, a classical guitar, an acoustic-electric classical guitar, an electric bass, and acoustic-electric bass, a keyboard, and a few other small instruments. Being surrounded by all of them makes me happy.

**FOR THE ROAD**
2009 has been pretty good to me so far, except for uncertainty in my career. Still not sure what to think about that, but hanging on for now. Love is in my life in many forms, and as long as that persists, all the other stuff can be taken care of somehow.
