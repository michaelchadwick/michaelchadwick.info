Much progress, however ancillary, has been made tonight.

With help from Robyn, the vocal chart has been improved and should be pretty done. Also, I successfully added lyrics to each &#8220;note tube&#8221; (as Harmonix calls them), so when you try to sing, words will help guide you :P

<!--more-->

I added Left-Hand animation cues for Guitar/Bass, but no Right-Hand, as I think the defaults are probably fine. As far as custom lighting or character animations&#8230;it&#8217;s kind of overwhelming what they let you do, and at this point I&#8217;d rather just get a working song, so they&#8217;re gonna stay at their default randomness for now.

I redid the Overdrive sections I originally, and haphazardly created, and added Unison sections, as well. Not sure they&#8217;re spaced out/positioned correctly, but only a playthrough will fix that.

Speaking of playthroughs, I tried building the .RPA file for the first time tonight. That is the proprietary format Rock Band takes for custom songs. It&#8217;s a mish mash of MIDI and WAV data, and I&#8217;ve already run into several show-stopping bugs in my MIDI that I need to fix before I get a clean build. Once I do, I think it&#8217;s ready for testing!

This thing is totally going to work. All my hard work over the last month is going to pay off. And if it goes well (whatever criteria I come up with to judge the &#8220;wellness&#8221; of it all is TBD), I may go through this craziness again, albeit with some experience under my belt and a sweet-ass template ready to go.

For now, time to unwind with some TV and then hit the hay. G&#8217;night, all.
