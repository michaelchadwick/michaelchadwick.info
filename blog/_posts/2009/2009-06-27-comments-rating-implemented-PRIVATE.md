It's finally the 90s over at [Nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com). Both posts and songs now have comments enabled. Just put a name and a message and click Post to have it saved for all time.

Also, each song has a little 1 to 5 star rating so that you can let me know, numerically, whether you enjoyed it.

I'm excited about both because I've never had so much interaction on my site, even if I'm about a decade behind in the technology :P
