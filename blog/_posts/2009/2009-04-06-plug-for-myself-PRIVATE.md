Nebyoolae.com has more or less been changed to its 2009 incarnation. If you haven&#8217;t checked it out lately, I&#8217;ve completely redone it. Again. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s immensely hackable in some way and/or buggy in IE6 or other outdated browser, but it should work, in general.

Like usual, I began a long list of changes and additions in this space and then realized if you care about it, you&#8217;ll just go and click on stuff, figuring out what&#8217;s new by yourself, and if not, you won&#8217;t read this or care about what has changed.

Thus, link: [http://nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com)
