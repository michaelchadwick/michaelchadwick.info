I was asked recently what kind of music I listen to. Save for just saying &#8220;basically anything,&#8221; I muddled my way through a few genres, but felt my response was lacking.

Since I&#8217;m listening to Pandora right now, I figured the artists I chose to seed my stations with are probably a decent look into my musical awareness (although, it doesn&#8217;t include the awesome stuff the seeds glean from P-Dora&#8217;s vast collection).

**Pandora Seeds**
Bing Crosby (Holiday)
Roni Size
Tool
Jonathan Coulton
Minotaur Shock
Minibosses
Fatboy Slim
Nine Inch Nails
Green Day
Spin Doctors
Liquid Tension Experiment
Soundgarden
Joe Satriani
Radiohead
Dream Theater
Pink Floyd
The Mars Volta
Days of the New
John Coltrane
Steve Reich
Maserati
Venetian Snares
Primus
Barenaked Ladies
Squarepusher
Tripping Daisy
Pearl Jam

Upon further reflection, it&#8217;s not as varied as I thought, as a lot of artists on the list share similar qualities. But it makes for an interesting playlist, nonetheless!
