I got a job!

<!--more-->

**IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR**
After about 6 months of searching (the last 3 being _fairly_ hardcore (and the last month or so being **quite** hardcore)), I&#8217;ve finally found a new position that is both full-time (40 hrs/wk) and stable (not a struggling dotcom).

After applying to about a dozen jobs via UCSD&#8217;s job board, some representative from their Temp Services division emailed me about a position at the UCSD Medical Center, Hillcrest that matched my skillset, and wondered if I was interested. The job is for .NET/MSSQL development, which I&#8217;m not too well-versed in, coming from an open-source Apache/MySQL/PHP background. However, I know the business world works in Microsoft land for the most part, so I think it would be useful to know it better. Also, I was desperate and WANT THE MONIES, so I said I was interested. I got a call later that day to schedule an interview. I went in the next day, interviewed, and was called the very next day with an offer. OMG. When it rains, it pours.

So, I start on Monday, July 27th (!!!!!!).

It&#8217;s kind of a shock. So many resumes sent out, so many applications filled out, and a handful of interviews that never went anywhere. All of that out the door now, and it&#8217;s definitely a relief. Of course, moving from my current position, which is 3 days a week, and even when I&#8217;m in the office it feels dead and pointless, to a full-time position with actual projects and work and challenges is causing me predictable amounts of anxiety.

Thankfully, the talk with my current employer went fine. They know things are bad, and employees looking for other work isn&#8217;t surprising. Now, I just need to properly dole out my responsibilities and do a little on-the-job training before I leave. That shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult :P

I&#8217;ll miss the people and the place and the familiar routine. I&#8217;ve been working at my current job for almost 4 years and it&#8217;s seen its share of highlights, for sure. This is my longest work tenure to date, so leaving is difficult in spirit, but easy in execution due to how bad things have gotten. I hope things turn around for them, but I&#8217;m not gonna be around to see whether it does or not.

To a new future (back) at UCSD!

**FOR THE ROAD**
I have a bunch of appointments to go to and tasks to process in order to prepare for my new job. TB test and background check and new employee orientation and dentist appointment are the ones coming up in the next week. Also, I should really start working on some .NET stuff, which includes reading some books to bone up on the whole operation. Too bad I suck at reading anything besides the web and comics. Despite having a MacBook as my main computer, I can still do stuff thanks to the VM of XP and VS/MSSQL 2k8 I got set up a few weeks ago. I&#8217;m both excited and scared to even begin, however.
