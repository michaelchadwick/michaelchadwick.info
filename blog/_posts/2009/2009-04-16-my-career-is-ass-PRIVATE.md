I&#8217;ve wanted to post about my diminishing value as both a systems administrator and web developer for a while now. My current job situation is not good and my prospects are currently nil. Weekly company meeting status reports range from &#8220;conflicted&#8221; to &#8220;bleak.&#8221; Today&#8217;s meeting was especially depressing. Still, even in a friends-only post, I don&#8217;t want to elaborate except to say that I&#8217;m scared.

I&#8217;ve been turned down or not even contacted for several positions applied to in the last 6 months (and, somewhat regrettably, I turned down one opportunity because it was too far away, available too soon, and most likely humbling). I feel like my skills as a sysadmin have atrophied over the past couple years due to disinterest, and my increasing interest in web development still feels sub-par when I really need it to be above-average to get a job doing it full-time at a competitive wage. Also, of course, my abilities as a composer continue to be unprofitable. I feel like a worthless slob who is living on borrowed time. With our rental lease coming up soon, being unemployed seems like it might hamper our lifestyle.

\***

Of course, I could continue to just wallow in self-pity and rue my unfortunate circumstances, or I could do something (more) about it. Right now, I&#8217;m going to wallow. Concurrently, I&#8217;m going to finish my lunch, help out a co-worker, and then go home and and jog 1.6 miles.

And tomorrow&#8230;tomorrow is another day to do something productive about it.
