Last weekend, Robyoolae and several other friends made our way to Augusta, GA and Morgana, SC for the marriage of Kate and Luke (Klute! It&#8217;s like an instrumental neologism). Trees, slight humidity, duplicitous road names and love were abundant. We did a bunch of stuff, but I&#8217;m too lazy to type anything more about it (except to say that I joined in a group interpretive dance of &#8220;Bohemian Rhapsody&#8221;).

Instead, read Robyn&#8217;s [report](http://oiseaurobyn.livejournal.com/391331.html).
