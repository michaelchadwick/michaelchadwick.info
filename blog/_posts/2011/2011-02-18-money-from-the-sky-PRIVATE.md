[Just yesterday](http://blog.nebyoolae.com/2011/02/17/4116) I said I wanted a new Mac. Well, when I came home that evening I checked the mail like usual. Inside was a sizable check for escrow account overpayment on our new home.

**Bamph**! Money from the sky.

The timing is incredible, too, because I [hear](http://www.9to5mac.com/52565/new-macbook-pros-drop-next-week-five-new-models) that MacBook Pros are about to get a refresh in the next week or two. Jumping from my 2 GHz Core 2 Duo MacBook with 2 GB RAM to a nice and shiny i5 MacBook Pro with 8 GB RAM and an actual 3D-acceleration card could be swell. All of a sudden waiting to purchase oneÂ is excruciating, but I will restrain my wallet. It&#8217;s only prudent on something that is so obviously a want.

Still, though. How did the stars align so perfectly like that?
