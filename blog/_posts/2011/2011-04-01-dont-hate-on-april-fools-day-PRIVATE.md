I&#8217;ve seen several people post (on the Internet!) that April Fool&#8217;s Day is lame, mainly because it makes the Internet a joke, diluting any &#8220;real&#8221; news that could be found. News flash people: you can barely trust what you read on the Internet on _any day_. Plus, on April Fool&#8217;s Day, at least you know people are _trying_ to be funny, unlike the usual unintentional hilarity that pops up here and there naturally.

I tend to like the more clever Fools over at Blizzard who seem to have unlimited creativity in this department. Check out their new [pitch-black dungeon](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2568252#blog) and successful resurrection of [Clippy](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2568248#blog).
