Every time I look at my blog&#8217;s mostÂ [recent posts view](http://blog.nebyoolae.com) (the homepage, essentially), after glancing at the header to once again criticize it for being meh and trying to think of ways to improve it, I casually glance over to the right at the sidebar, looking for the &#8220;View Friends List&#8221;-type link.

**Spoiler:** It&#8217;s not there.

I know I&#8217;ve already groused about [this](http://blog.nebyoolae.com/2011/03/09/4349), but keeping all of your friends&#8217; blog updates on one domain is still something I miss.
