When I first started playing video games regularly, at the age of 5, there was only one &#8220;real&#8221; choice: the NES. You bought one and then regularly filled it up with the creative sluice that NOA or its third-party friends produced. Once the SNES came out you stopped buying NES games and started buying SNES games instead. There would be side purchases for the Game Boy, too. I even dabbled in the realm of Sega with a Game Gear at one point (man, that name makes little sense to me now). But whatever the Nintendo machine at the time was, that&#8217;s what you worshipped.

Our family procured a Pentium-class Windows 3.1-running (soon after upgraded to 95) personal computer in 1995. All of a sudden there was reason to pause when thoughts turned to the purchase of a new video game. Since the PC was new and shiny, I probably sided with it for a while, purchasing gleaming discs of wonder that took anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to install to the local hard drive. Then&#8230;sometimes there was the need for configuration. Actually, sometimes there was just the simple _joy_ of configuration. I always have a desire to click on an &#8220;Options&#8221; or &#8220;Settings&#8221; or &#8220;Customize&#8221; button as soon as I have access to it. Let&#8217;s see what I can change, right? That in and of itself was a pleasurable game.

In the end, I probably ended up spending more money on computer games than console games throughout high school and even beyond college. The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 took up a large chunk of cash themselves for many years, as did the DS, which started to change the flow of money. However, it wasn&#8217;t until the time that my current console, the Xbox 360, came out that I kind of just stopped buying PC games. My most recent Windows system continued to age and need upgrades to keep up with the advancement of gaming software, which made buying games on a console less fraught with peril. Just pop it in and you&#8217;d know it would work, and run well. Coupling that with my switch of a Windows XP architecture to OS X for everyday computing, I started to forget about Microsoft-led personal computers as my main source of gaming entertainment.

The current makeup of computer technology in my house further accentuates this shift in gaming preference. There&#8217;s an aging Athlon XP PC downstairs, booted up solely to run a DDR emulator, and there&#8217;s a Dell Zino in the living room, largely woken from sleep to play NetFlix or DVDs. Except for a brief fling with the Nintendo Wii, I now primarily buy games for the 360, accomplishing all other computery-type things on my MacBook Pro. When a new game comes out that is cross-platform, I instinctively choose the Xbox because I know it&#8217;ll run well at 1080p and I won&#8217;t have to configure or install anything. Macs still aren&#8217;t often chosen as platforms for gaming, and the PCs we have aren&#8217;t top-of-the-line. It&#8217;s just easier to use the console, just like back in the NES days.

Occasionally, though, either Blizzard or Valve releases a new game and my Mac actually stands a chance at winning this contest. That game as of late is Portal 2. I played Portal, part of the Orange Box, on my Xbox 360, and it was glorious. Running any of the games in that collection on a 42&#8243; HDTV is joy incarnate. Why, then, did I end up choosing to get the Steam version on my Mac (after previously pre-ordering it for Xbox 360 like clockwork)? Well, my new MBP, acquired earlier this year, is actually pretty decent, and even has a 3D accelerator card. This means Portal 2 may actually run well. Plus, it has a co-op mode that I&#8217;d like to play with others, and all my friends are getting it for PC/Mac, so it behooves me to follow suit if I want that to be a reality. Currently, the game&#8217;s data is pre-loaded through Steam, waiting for the unlock to engage from Valve. Not having to get a disc that then needs to hog my Xbox 360&#8217;s DVD tray is actually pretty nice, and if I want the HDTV treatment I can just grab a cable to connect my Mac to it.

This decision feels like an anomaly, not something that will be oft repeated. As good as my laptop may now be, the 360 will still usually run games at the highest settings (read: the only settings available) with little difficulty, while it&#8217;s more of a risk on the Mac. This fear, in lieu of a demo to remedy it, will probably keep me from making this a habit.

\***

All right. Enough of this analysis. Portal 2 may actually come out _today_, people! Can&#8217;t wait to get home if that comes true.
