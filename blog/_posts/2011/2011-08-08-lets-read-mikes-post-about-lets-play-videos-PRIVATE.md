**THE SETUP**

****If you&#8217;re anything like me, the act of playing video games started young. My first real ensnarement by the disease that would later be known as vidiotry came in the form of Christmas morning, 1985. My dad and I played both Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda on a shiny new Nintendo Entertainment System. I was 5 years and 2 and a half weeks old. It basically changed my life.

Except for portable game systems, for most of my formative years (5-20) gaming meant sitting somewhere, looking at a TV screen, and pushing a directional pad and some buttons (if console) or moving/clicking on a mouse with one hand, fingers poised on a keyboard with the other (if PC).

Today, gaming is much more mainstream and accepted. What it means &#8220;to game&#8221; encompasses more avenues now. It could mean playing a quick game of Drop 7 on your iPhone to kill 5 minutes, loading up your saved game in Fallout: New Vegas and advancing the story for a few hours, moving a wand-like controller (or even your whole body) around to make an on-screen avatar do your bidding, or clicking on a virtual farm in a browser while perusing a social network.

**THE POINT**

However you gamed, you most likely did it yourself, actively. Of course, there&#8217;s something to be said for handing the reins to someone else, too. While I&#8217;ve done my fair share of active gaming, I also really enjoy passive gaming. Watching someone else play a game can be just as fun, if not more so in some cases.

There are several valid reasons for being a passive gamer. Maybe you weren&#8217;t as good at the game, and wanted someone with superior ability to play instead to minimize the frustration. Maybe you weren&#8217;t interested in actually thinking about how the game worked, but still wanted to see it in action. Maybe, in fact, you didn&#8217;t even have the game, but were interested in seeing it (and a trailer wasn&#8217;t enough). There were a lot of games released in the past few decades, and odds are you haven&#8217;t seen/played them all. You may also have enjoyed playing a game in your youth and wanted to revisit it later without (re)investing the time it takes to (re)learn the game again to enjoy it. Having a professional (or comedically unprofessional) tour would be nice, eh?

Enter: [Let&#8217;s Play](http://lparchive.org).

I think I remember seeing these kinds of videos pop up on [SomethingAwful](http://somethingawful.com) back in the day (man, I haven&#8217;t visited that site in a looooong time). In the time since I regularly visited that site, the idea seems to have spread to the General Internet, with the requisite web archive interface springing up. In fact, the LP Archive confirms my suspicions about its roots on its [history page](http://lparchive.org/history).

I can&#8217;t get enough of these videos! They satisfy both my curiosity for and laziness excuse against playing old (and some current) video games. Instead of slogging through an old game that I only have a passing interest in, I instead load up an LP and have someone else give me a tour. My curiosity is sated and I get some fun entertainment. It&#8217;s generally a win/win. Sometimes, it merely lights the fire I needed to try out the game for myself (like an extended, non-playable demo).

If you find this kind of thing as enjoyable as I do, keep in mind that not all LPs are videos, or have funny/useful audio commentary. Some people just use screenshots and text, which are not usually my bagatelle, but you may find interesting, anyway. Also, the LP Archive doesn&#8217;t contain all suchness of this sort, and a general YouTube search will find many more &#8220;unofficial&#8221; LPs.

**FOR THE ROAD**

Gaming can sometimes seem daunting to those who are not accustomed to its conventions. Picking up a controller and manipulating an avatar in a virtual environment can seem overwhelmingly difficult. In times when that&#8217;s the case, let someone else do it for you. Check out an [LP](http://lparchive.org) today!
