## AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR

It rained a hell of a lot last night and into the morning. Driving home from a friend&#8217;s place in the ensuing stormpocalype was unnerving. This is what happens to someone whose only serious car accident was while driving home at night in the rain. Every darkened vehicular journey becomes a bit of a PTSD-type situation.Â My wife and I got home safely, thankfully. Sleep found us both soon after.

I had a dream that involved a meeting between a bunch of people and some kind of alien/mutant race of creatures, like we were having peace talks with them. Sitting near one of these unidentified beings, I could see they were definitely humanoid, but had odd facial features, and were lumbering hulks. One of them was just to my left, translating what the others were saying for us. A friend of a friend later showed me, in a back room, the arsenal he had stockpiled just in case the aliens became aggressive. Later, just before waking up, I remembered observing that all hell had broken loose and the aliens had done just that. I woke up before anything really happened, but I was filled with a sense of dread all the same.

## ON SATURDAY, OR HOW WE WALKED ON THE HIGHWAY

Currently, the main highway that connects our town to the rest of San Diego stops just short of actually entering it. You have to get off on one of two roads that then drive through the more residential or more commercial parts of it. Eventually, you connect back up with a different major highway. What this means is that we have to exit the faster avenue for the slower one several miles before our actual house, replete with 35-40 speed limits and several traffic lights.

Well, starting next weekend, that&#8217;ll all change, as they have extended the main highway all the way through town!

In fact, we even got to _walk on the new highway extension_ that we will soon be driving on. Robyn, Lea, and I attended the Highway Extension party organized to celebrate this wondrous addition which, despite seeming pretty hick (i.e. making a big deal out of what urban city dwellers would probably consider mundane), was actually pretty fun. You don&#8217;t get to walk straight down (the wrong side!) of an actual highway very often, save for when you&#8217;re on TV or in a movie and your vehicle has broke down and the inevitable walk to a gas station 50 miles away ensues. Tons of people were there, and they had classic cars, food/vendor booths, and an official walk across the whole thing that started before we even got there. I even got interviewed on camera by some senior at SDSU for answering a couple softball questions about living in our town.

All in all, it was a nice way to spend a couple hours. People watching enjoyment was at a significant high, the weather kept its precipitation largely in its pocket, and I got to add something to my bucket list I&#8217;d never thought would be there.

## I LOVE YOU, MAN(G)

Just saw the bromance comedy starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel. It was formulaic and coarse in all the ways you&#8217;d guess, but it was still enjoyable. Paul Rudd is adorable (but Rashida Jones is more so), and Jason Segel is Marshall, single, before he meets Lilly. Also, they rock the Canada out of some Rush songs. What more could you ask for?

## FOR THE ROAD

Still playing WoW. Both Robyn and I are at level 51. Still impressed occasionally with how they&#8217;ve changed up some of the quests in areas I visited many years ago, keeping the experience fairly fresh. I especially liked how Blizzard references one of their oldest games (The Three Vikings) in one of the quests now.
