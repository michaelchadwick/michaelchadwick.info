Except for the first time I did my own taxes, the dawning of the Day In Which We Get Our W-2s has never brought much fear to the table. Nothing worth chowing down on, anyway. No itemization meant taking the standard deduction and the whole shebang never took longer than 30 minutes.

Of course, that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been doing 1040EZ Street, USA 12345 the whole time. Further still, I&#8217;ve used Turbo Tax&#8217;s online offering for many years now, and its gentle, if not sometimes overwhelmingly thorough, hand-holding always seems to make the whole process feel like little more than a glorified web form.

Last year I got married _and_ I bought a house. Thus, 2010&#8217;s taxes were going to be a bit more complicated. Thankfully, though, Turbo Tax came through in spades again, rife with the same comforting hand-holding previously mentioned. It was even up-to-date on all of the housing questions we had, especially the new home-buyer credits. Technology is grand, I tell ya.

The whole rigmarole would have been perfect if it weren&#8217;t for our inability to E-File like usual (because of the aforementioned housing credit) and T-Tax&#8217;s moment of disability in allowing us to still E-File our state taxes, regardless. Instead, we had to actually _print out the forms to mail them in_. Like, on paper. Like, folded and placed into an envelope and affixed with a stamp. It was a dark 5 minutes as our nation&#8217;s resources were violated, slowly plodding out from the printer&#8217;s out hole.

At least they&#8217;re done, right? Well, they _will_ be done&#8230;once we actually procure actual envelopes. Not sending any correspondence in the snail mail system causes your business envelope supply to situate itself in non-existent territory.
