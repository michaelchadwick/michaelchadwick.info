Way back in August 2010 my wife and I embarked on the task of painting the interior of our home. We moved in to it in late May 2010, staring at stark white walls everywhere. I&#8217;ve lived in many places that had the same austere accoutrement and, except for one place, never painted anything. Renters usually have to paint whatever they paint during their residency back to the original color, and I never felt anything was worth that. Once you buy something and can do anything you want to it, the stakes change. I definitely had to be talked into it, and the process was arduous, but the results were worth it.

Over the last 8-9 months, a combination of two people painted four bathrooms, four bedrooms, a kitchen three (!) times, a living room, a loft, a downstairs hallway, and an entryway. We finished the last bedroom+bathroom (the master) this last weekend, which was actually the 1-yr anniversary of our house being built and our move-in. We didn&#8217;t necessarily plan it that way, but for it to happen like that is satisfying. Our house, once filled with bare white, is now a mixture of beige, creamy yellow, soft blues and greens, and soothing gray.

Since we&#8217;re part of an HOA the exterior color is pre-determined. This is actually good because we live in a three-story place, and climbing up to paint the second (let alone the third) floor sounds daunting. I already got my fix of death-defying painting while coating the inside walls that stretch past the second floor and through the third. Standing on ladders wielding a 20+ foot extension pole was fun in a &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad when this is over&#8221; kind of way.

After all the painting was done, our house seemed pretty complete save for some furniture rearranging. We moved our old nightstands out of the bedroom, buying some new matching ones in their place. An entertainment center, replete with an LCD TV, an Apple TV, and a DVD player, got moved into the guest bedroom. My wife&#8217;s desk, previously perched high above in a no-purpose-room, became imbued with purpose as it moved into the vacant corner that was left. Finally, we moved two tall bookcases up to the same no-purpose-room, which is rapidly becoming the Furniture Graveyard Room. I think Craigslist is in our immediate future. The bedroom now seems bigger and more adult.

It&#8217;s good to complete projects&#8230;even if it takes nearly a year.
