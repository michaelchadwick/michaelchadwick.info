No longer do I drive a 2003 Saturn Ion 2. No longer do I drive the car that I once drove home, north on the 805, from my friend Kim&#8217;s place, in the rain, at 4 in the morning, and crashed into the guardrail as the road peaked the 8 below. No longer do I drive the car that pulled into a car port without hitting the posts holding it up at my old apartment hundreds of times. No longer do I drive the car I used to move from La Jolla to Tierrasanta to Santee. No longer do I drive the car I used to drive to the first date with the woman who would later become my wife. No, I no longer drive it. That car now sits at the Irvine Subaru dealership. In exchange, Robyn and I took home a brand spankin-new 2011 Outback, their &#8220;wagon&#8221; model.

You could say I was a little attached to &#8220;The Green Hornet&#8221;. Alas, it&#8217;s time for new, new, new!

The Outback is a different animal than my Saturn. You sit higher than someone in a sedan, but not as high as someone in a full-blown SUV or truck. It&#8217;s kind of nice. The steering wheel feels more substantial. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m piloting a tank at times. The turning radius is really good, though, and it goes as fast as my old car, mainly because of its better engine. In essence, it&#8217;s a sweet car. While it will be driven by me in a &#8220;get to work and back&#8221; kind of way, it&#8217;s really _our_ car, in that when you&#8217;re married and both need the specs of a certain kind of vehicle (cargo space, back leg room), you both end up using it. Robyn never liked driving my old car, so the Outback is a fresh start for both of us. Intertwined driving.

Why get a new car? Basically, my old (~8 years-old) Saturn was getting on in years and quality. The windshield had a crack, the AC was unreliable, the seats were stained, and it needed new front struts. It had been in an accident (described above), and was | | <&#8211; that close to being a total loss, so despite the remarkable skill of the body shop that worked on it, certain things never felt quite as good as they did before. Fixing all of these things could probably be measured in the > $1000 arena, which was about half the value of the car in total. Still, it ran fine otherwise, and was suitable for my needs (get to work and back, and occasionally visit friends/run errands). Of course, when you get married and also realize you don&#8217;t absolutely hate the idea of dependents (animals, children, etc.), you realize that it might be nice to have a vehicle that can comfortably transport these &#8220;life changers&#8221;. Also, have you seen the amount of back seat leg room Outbacks have? It&#8217;s a lot.

Regardless of the &#8220;family car&#8221; moniker that this new vehicle certainly deserves, it also has a lot of creature features my Saturn was woefully lacking. A list follows:

* Power windows and locks (Saturn had locks, but not windows)
* Moonroof
* Bluetooth
* A much larger trunk
* Cargo cover
* All-weather floor mats, trunk mat, and wipers
* Remote keyless entry
* Auto-dimming rearview mirror
* Rearview backup camera
* Heated seats
* Heated side mirrors
* Reclining back seats
* Power driver&#8217;s seat controls
* Outdoor temperature gauge
* Compass in rearview mirror
* Visors with extensions
* Continuously variable transmission (automatic + semi-manual)
* Cupholders in the doors
* Automatic head lights
* Radio mute button (it&#8217;s useful, people!)
* More configurable wiper speed
* Cruise control
* Curtain airbags
* Armrest between front seats
* Backseat privacy glass

There might be more, but that&#8217;s probably enough to get the point across.

It&#8217;s a new era. I don&#8217;t drive a sedan &#8212; I drive a wagon. Like, a station wagon. Like, something my parents may have driven in the 70s. Only it&#8217;s now 2011 and I&#8217;m 30. And I&#8217;m planning to have a family which may include a dog (we may retry this idea after our initial debacle &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to see) and a child. This car will be more useful for that future which has not yet become the present. I&#8217;m not usually one for putting a bunch of money down on something that is still potential (even if it&#8217;s planned potential), so I fought the decision a lot. I also miss my simple, beaten-up, and yet still useful car. Getting used to driving the Outback will largely be mental, not physical, as it drives a lot like the Prius, which I now have 4 years of experience driving. I am infinitely adaptable, however, so it will soon become second-nature. Until then, I&#8217;m going to hit Publish on this post and begin this new journey of car ownership, cursing the presence of a monthly loan payment I had abolished a few years ago (paying off my old car), and yet enjoying the wonderfulness of having a new vehicle again.
