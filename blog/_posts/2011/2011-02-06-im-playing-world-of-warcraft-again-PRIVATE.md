I&#8217;m not sure why, but the ability to check out what&#8217;s going on in the land of Azeroth for free seemed like a good idea recently. Despite not playing for about 5-6 years, and not having any real desire to play again, I found myself creating a 10-day trial account.

_&#8220;Robyn? I did a bad thing.&#8221;_

There&#8217;s a lot of negative association with the World of Warcraft. Relationships have been torn asunder and lives have been ruined just because of this game. People completely zone out in a virtual world, using accomplishments they achieve there as placeholders for real world ones. Perspective can be lost easily. It&#8217;s crazy.

Back in 2005, I was playing regularly, as were several friends, and even my girlfriend. It was fun. It was a fun timesink, like a lot of other video games. I played several characters, my best reaching level 58 (the cap at the time was 60). I put a lot of hours into it, staying up late, plowing through quests and losing lots of sleep. WoW gives you lots to do, and it&#8217;s all carefully metered out so that it can eat through time like a sharp knife through hot butter. Each new quest and exciting reward is doled out carefully, ramping up the complexity and difficulty just right to keep you hooked.

_&#8220;I want a Massively Parallel Online game.__&#8220;_

As much as I enjoyed playing, I never quite got over needing to group with other people. I&#8217;ve been a solo gamer most of my life, and the requirement of being in a group of other players, interacting in a structured manner that didn&#8217;t just consist of swearing at each other in a room was often more of a drag than a boon. It just wasn&#8217;t my style and I didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as a short-term grouping of only a few people or just striking out on my own, uninhibited by others&#8217; needs or desires. The instanced dungeons usually brought a grimace to my face instead of a gleaming smile. One exception that worked fine, though: playing as a pair with my girlfriend. We worked well as a team and it was easy enough to work with just one other person. After I stopped playing in June of 2005, a few months passed before I went back with her, got both of our characters to 40, purchased mounts, took a screenshot, and simultaneously quit for good.

Until now, of course.

_&#8220;You can&#8217;t even tradeÂ as a trial account?!&#8221;_

The trial account multiplied to two trial accounts as my wife, through some apprehension, joined me. My level 8 mage was a bit ahead of her newly minted level 1 hunter, but she could catch up quickly. A few hours later, she had. Of course, since we were both trial accounts, we couldn&#8217;t actually join a party together or trade with each other, so it was kind of a hassle. Today, we decided that it was worth unearthing our old accounts, making new characters, and redoing the 5 hours of leveling we had just done recently. Less than 3 hours later, we had gone from level 1 to level 10.

_&#8220;Heh. I see they have an alarm function so that you can remind yourself to take a break.&#8221;_

Not much has changed in the actual beginning areas, but the interface has many new tweaks and the general level of hand-holding has increased significantly. Not much need for mods since all the useful ones seem baked in now. Tutorial dialogs are everywhere, even instructing you on how to use time-honored keyboard input schemes (press WASD on your keyboard to move!). It&#8217;s more than I need since I remembered a lot of how the game is played, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s great for the overal accessibility. Knowing where your next quest is located and being able to track it on a minimap, overhead map, and on-screen quest log is very helpful, however.

_&#8220;Holy crap! That flying mount looks sweet. I want a flying mount.&#8221;_

The game runs great on my 4 year-old MacBook, even at a decent resolution. As long as you&#8217;re not on the noob server, there isn&#8217;t any noticeable lag from the overwhelming presence of new players. The gameplay is repetitive, yet familiar and comforting, and doing quests with someone else in the room makes for fun times. In what may be a foolish prediction, we both aim to play for the month our credit cards have been charged, and make a decision as to whether we play further once it has elapsed. Just going through each zone to see how it&#8217;s changed from the ramifications of Cataclysm will be interesting, even without reaching the initial level cap of 60, let alone buying any of the expansions for more zones, classes, or level cap extensions.

_&#8220;I saw a flower shop before logging out, so I sent you some :-)&#8221;_

I gave a lot of crap to people who kept playing WoW after I quit in 2005. I&#8217;m sure I felt better than them for &#8220;kicking the addiction&#8221; and experiencing other things. A good friend of mine got really into it and we stopped talking often for several years. He has since stopped playing it nearly as much and we started hanging out again. WoW wasn&#8217;t the only reason for the lapse in communication, but it didn&#8217;t help. Even though I wasn&#8217;t playing, I was interested in the goings-on in the game, but at fairly shallow point my interest waned due to any recent experience.

It&#8217;s all kind of a double-edged sword. It&#8217;s a fun game that can and will dominate your interests, and to play it in moderation is the goal. Playing it at the expense of any other interest can and will make you seem uninteresting if the interest isn&#8217;t shared, and can have a negative effect on the balance of your life. Otherwise, the stigma is pretty overrated for most people who don&#8217;t have an alarmingly addictive personality.

Blizzard puts a lot of effort into the game&#8217;s visual and aural characteristics, and spends a lot of time making the world seem alive. It&#8217;s commendable. You want to hang out in their world and you want to see other people hang out in it and interact with them. Just don&#8217;t forget about the world outside Azeroth and you&#8217;ll be good. I plan to continue doing the other things I hold dear in addition to my rekindled interest in WoW. I will once again refrain from losing any jobs or getting completely lost in Blizzard&#8217;s online virtual world. That&#8217;s my goal, anyway.
