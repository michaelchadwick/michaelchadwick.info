Anyone who knows me knows that the only reading I usually do is random stuff on the Internet. Novels are not something I read very often, even though I enjoy it when I do. My reading speed consists of fairly quick, moderately long spurts, often separated by several months (even on just one book). Because of my inability to maintain my interest in reading novels, I don&#8217;t do it a lot.

However, due to several recommendations, I picked up Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s fantasy adventure &#8220;The Name of the Wind&#8221; for the iBooks app on my iPhone (a great way to get me to read, as my phone&#8217;s always with me) and finally finishedÂ today after a couple months of on-and-off consumption. To say it is &#8220;Harry Potter, but better&#8221; would not be terribly accurate, but it&#8217;s a start. Regardless, it&#8217;s gripping and well-written. Of course, it&#8217;s merely the setup book for the next one, called &#8220;Wise Man&#8217;s Fear,&#8221; which came out today.

A friend was gracious enough to go purchase me and some friends copies of it, and we&#8217;ll be taking them to the Mystery Galaxy Bookstore [this Saturday](http://www.mystgalaxy.com/event/patrick-rothfuss-signs) to actually meet the author, listen to him do some reading, and have him sign our book. I&#8217;ve never gone to a book signing before, but I assume it will be filled with rabid fans who may or may not froth a bit too much at the mouth, much like any kind of convention filled with sometimes obsessed consumers. I liked the book a lot, and the Q&A about how the signing will work was amusing, but I am not OMG HOLY CRAP about meeting him. I suspect he will be a cool guy and it&#8217;ll be neat to meet him, though.

Moreover, I look forward to reading the next installment of the adventures of Kvothe! Don&#8217;t be surprised if I don&#8217;t finish it until the third book comes out.

**EDIT**: the book signing was great! Patrick is funny and kind. Woo.
