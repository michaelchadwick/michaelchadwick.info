Taking care of a puppy is not the same as taking care of  a human baby. The level of responsibility is very different. However, both activities really make you rethink and reevaluate things.

Our collie, Penny, sees and reacts to the world in a different way than we do. Right now, she&#8217;s very skittish when outside. Outside has a bunch of unknown variables. Keeping her to a simple routine when we go on our walks, taking her along the same route to the same places, helps to keep her calm (relatively), but is no guarantee. Planes, cars, bikes, people, and other dogs are just some of the things she tends to tense up around.

When she&#8217;s calm, she walks at a constant pace, stopping sporadically to sniff and look around. When she&#8217;s in panic mode, triggered by something strange she can&#8217;t quite process, she walks much faster, tugging on the leash, heading back to our house. She won&#8217;t make eye contact and she&#8217;s not interested in treats or petting.

It all takes you back to being young and new to the world. There is **so much stuff** going on at all times, guys! In life, it seems like we just grow better and better at filtering out what we&#8217;re not focused on. Penny, on the other hand, does not seem to currently possess that ability. It takes little to freak her out, much like someone who is simply fearful of the unknown. It can be frustrating for her owners who are not flinching at every horn honk or vent noise.

Hopefully, this is a growing pain and she&#8217;ll be less terrified of the world outside our home some day soon :-)
