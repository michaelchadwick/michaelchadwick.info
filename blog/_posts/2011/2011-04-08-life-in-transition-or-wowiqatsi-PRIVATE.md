I&#8217;ve felt particularly _college_ lately. I&#8217;m married and own a house, which feels pretty _post-college_, but still&#8230;many things in my life right now remind me of how life was back then:

  * working a temp job (sorta like part-time)
  * playing a lot of World of Warcraft
  * buying expansions for World of Warcraft (this didn&#8217;t happen in college, but it was essentially like buying 8 months of game time (also, flying mounts, man!))
  * not getting my hair cut (it is the longest it&#8217;s ever been)
  * unrelenting, overt consumption with no motivation to create (this is more of a cycle, really)
  * having no particular strong life direction
  * playing DDR for main source of exercise, but more often doing nothing
  * long-form blogging! (heh)

This list is not intended to complain or despair. Life is good. I mean, I&#8217;m happy and can pay my bills and I have no specific complaint about anything. Still, the anecdotal evidence of my circle of friends furthering their full-time careers and having kids seems to point toward me lagging behind in some kind of man-child, Peter Pan syndrome way. I&#8217;ve never wanted to &#8220;grow up,&#8221; really, honestly liking what life was like back in my early 20s. Few responsibilities and hedonism often unchecked. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s stress-free for the most part. Going through a time-honored and time-tested routine each day with my wife is good. I love her. I love my friends, too.

Still. Society would tell me I&#8217;m in transition right now. This is a lull that&#8217;s not intended to last. Eventually, I will have a child to take care of and/or a job that&#8217;s more involved and character-building and stressful (that hopefully pays more for the added difficulty). Then I&#8217;ll move beyond this transitional period, put my play things away, and finally &#8220;grow up&#8221;.

Except it doesn&#8217;t have to be exactly that way&#8230;right?
