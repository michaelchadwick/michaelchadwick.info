Liszt?

A short list of concerts attended kept lengthening over the years on my old LJ, measuring almost 50 units in total. It was fun to update it when I went to a new one, although I haven&#8217;t been to one in (\*checks\*) **16 months**. This is&#8230;kind of appalling.

Anywho. I took that old post and turned it into a WordPress Page. I figured other periods-of-time-that-can-be-chunked should be added as separate lists, too, so books, games, and movies are on the page, as well. Anytime I finish one of these things I&#8217;ll update it. Right now, besides the concert list, the page is woefully unfinished, so don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve only begun watching movies, reading books, and playing games since a year or so ago.
