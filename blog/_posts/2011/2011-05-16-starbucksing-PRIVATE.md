You know the clich√© of the modern day business &#8220;warrior&#8221; chilling at a Starbucks (or other coffee shop, but mainly the former), laptop in front of them, coffee at the side, hacking away at whatever, be it a website, novel, or expense report? Yeah, well&#8230;that&#8217;s me right now.

My car is in the shop getting some work done, and I figured I&#8217;d just go and do the aforementioned thing for a while. This place is busy, so I had to actually go outside and grab a table instead of a nice leather-backed lounge seat. Getting here at 8:20am is apparently not early enough to stake out a desirable claim inside, which is something to note for any future endeavors of the like. People keep arriving and leaving with alarming regularity, making me wonder if I should reattempt a claim inside, but I think I&#8217;ll just stick to my table here.

The image of Sbux being a present-day oasis for the working (and non-working?) class is quite true. It feels homey, I guess, although it&#8217;s weird for me to use my computer out in public where others could see me and JUDGE. I know the judgement anxiety is irrational and no one really cares what I&#8217;m doing, but the all-seeing public eye nevertheless persists in my head.

I haven&#8217;t worked on a website besides little fixes here and there at my now-old job (!) in several months, and I feel rusty. Of course, the first time I load up <http://nebyoolae> to have a look-see, MySQL barfs about the damnable &#8220;mysql.sock&#8221; file yet again, a recurring bane of my existence. Also, since moving to my new computer I no longer have a version of Photoshop in which to create new graphics for things, which limits my options to improve some things. Also also, the wi-fi provided by Starbucks is very nice, but it sure ain&#8217;t as fast as the service we have at home.

OK, enough stalling. Time to actually start some work.
