**READING**

About halfway done with Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s _[The Name of the Wind](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp)._ You can tell how easily distracted I can be since despite the book being really good, I still go long stretches of time without reading it. The sequel comes out in about a week and I&#8217;m going to a book signing for it, so I should really hunker down on this.

**GAMING**

Playing WoW (again) still. It feels like it did many years ago. All the changes make things fresh and rediscovering things left dormant all this time is still fun. Thanks to the new dungeon-group-finder thingy I&#8217;m doing them waaaaay more often than I did before (read: more than almost never).

**TELEVISION**

Not watching anything new. Keeping up with _The Office_, _The Big Bang Theory_, _How I Met Your Mother_, _30 Rock_, and _Community_. Still catching the odd episode of _TDS/CR_ here and there.

**MUSIC**

Relapsing into listening to only NES/SNES/GB chiptunes at work. I haven&#8217;t picked up a guitar in a while (again). Waiting for the new MBPs to come out before I delve back into working on _Dumeh_.

**WEB DEV**

Fixing bugs here and there on my main sites, but nothing new. I think I want to start a new project, but I&#8217;ve got no ideas and so my interest is currently low. At work I actually was able to build some custom Sharepoint Web Parts, which made me feel somewhat accomplished.
