No matter the instrumentation or style, good music is good music. This means I usually like just about anything that can be reasonably groked (and even some that can&#8217;t). However, more and more I find that the kind of music more-easily created using a computer and sequencer, using synths and samples, is the kind I like the most. It&#8217;s like a mix of my childhood (video games) and my current abilities (Logic) rolled into one. When I hear it, it almost immediately puts me in a good, head-bobbin&#8217; mood.

Big Giant Circles, the musical persona of Jimmy Hinson, just released his [debut album](http://biggiantcircles.bandcamp.com/). After listening to 1.2 tracks, I knew I had to have it. Bought, downloaded, and playing. It&#8217;s got contributions from everyone to Minecraft composer _C418_, to VVVVVVV maestro _souleye_, to my personal favorite songcrafter _Disasterpeace_.
