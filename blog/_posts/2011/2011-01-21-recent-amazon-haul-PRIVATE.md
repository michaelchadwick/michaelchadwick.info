My dear, sweet mother got me some Amazon giftcards for both my birthday (Dec 9) and Christmas (Dec 25). Robyn got me the new car stereo I&#8217;d wanted, so I had to stop and think for several weeks about what I desired. As usual, my eventual choice was to get several things of some small variety:

  1. [Logitech Revue keyboard/mouse combo](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Controller-Revue-Google/dp/B0040QE998). This isÂ for our living room PC and will increase our desire to use it (we were using a separate keyboard and mouse before). It&#8217;s intended to be used with the Google TV, but it works fairly well without it, too
  2. _Just a Geek_ and _Dancing Barefoot_ by Wil Wheaton. He&#8217;s been a writer/blogger for a long time and I figured it was time to finally read his dead-tree work.
  3. [Western Digital WD Elements 2TB external hard drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QEBMCI/ref=oss_product) for my new Time Machine backup drive. I&#8217;ll be moving all my samples and music projects to my current, 640GB, external drive. I know it&#8217;s probably overkill, but I&#8217;m trying to make this somewhat future-proof.
  4. [Belkin 7-port USB hub](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NAXC6G/ref=oss_product). I&#8217;m using a pretty sweet HP one that has both USB and FW, but I realized I need the additional USB ports more than any FW ports. I only have the Firepod that _needs_ FW, anyway, and my MacBook has one that will fulfill that need.
  5. [Native Instruments&#8217; Komplete 7 Elements sample library](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZZUHEG/ref=oss_product). I&#8217;ve been desiring some new quality samples to play with, and getting Komplete 7 was $400 more, so hopefully this will tide me over for now.
  6. [The Ruby Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516177/ref=oss_product) by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto. Always good to have a paper reference when learning a new language.

It&#8217;ll take a bit to get 3-5 up and running as the initial time investment is not trivial, but hopefully it will invigorate me to create some music. 2011 has been musically dead so far, and I aim to change that.
