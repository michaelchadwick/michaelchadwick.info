Through a combination of Firewire target disc mode, an external hard drive, Dropbox, and a few Internet downloads, I&#8217;ve got my new computer up and running for the most part. It is _usable_ (to me). It&#8217;s not a proper DAW yet, though, as I still have to install my newly-acquired Logic Studio (10.0?) software and remake all of my symlinks to sound libraries. It is then that I will attempt to finish &#8220;Dumeh&#8221;. As far as being a good programming environment, there&#8217;s a lot to do there, too. Besides installing Textmate, I still need to migrate my old command line prompt environment, configure Apache, and install a bunch of Ruby gems.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ve largely had it anchored to the dining table, leveling up a character (or two (or three)) in World of Warcraft. When the game is running, the area of the laptop above the keyboard, right below the screen, gets pretty darn hot. I&#8217;ve been told by my wife that this is normal, but it actually makes the keys near the top somewhat unsettling to touch. This is not something I was used to on the MacBook. It got hot on the bottom, just like this one, but I never felt the heat bubble up to the actual keyboard. Hmmm.

As far as performance, it is a breath of a (sometimes disconcertingly hot) fresh air. The 1680 x 1050 screen is beautiful, things load noticeably faster, and I can actually run games at levels above &#8220;Low&#8221; without massive choppiness. Doubling up the RAM from 2 to 4 GB probably helps just as much as moving from a Core 2 Duo to an i7. Oh, and the inclusion of an actual 3D acceleration graphics card might have improved things, too. Maybe. I even set aside 100 GB for a Boot Camp install of Windows 7 which, despite crashing on shutdown/restart, works well otherwise.

The slick unibody design is nice and even though it&#8217;s a 15&#8243; screen (compared to my old 13&#8243;) the weight of it hasn&#8217;t increased significantly. It was not cheap, but it was worth it. The resale value on my old one is much higher than I&#8217;d think, so I&#8217;ll hopefully get a not-insignificant amount for it, recouping quite a bit of my investment into the new one.

In the end, it&#8217;s still just a Mac. All the things that come with the purchase and use of a Mac continue to be true on this computer, just as they were before. I like the look, feel, and experience I get while using OS X and its associated programs. The specs aren&#8217;t state-of-the-art. The performance is not revolutionary. It is a visually pleasing, input responsive, solidly-made, somewhat overpriced laptop computer that is portable, yet powerful. It gets hot, which is a natural byproduct of energy consumption. It gets a bit too hot for my tastes and usage, but I&#8217;ll learn to deal with it. Overall, I am happy with my technology purchase and would recommend it to anyone who likes things that are good.
