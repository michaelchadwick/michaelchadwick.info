In case you&#8217;re not actually seeing this post in its natural habitat, Lazy in the Blog has the new look above. Let me explain why.

I&#8217;m always looking at user interfaces, observing the widgets and styles people concoct to connect the user to the system. I look at my personal websites and constantly see things I want to change, this cycling iterative process of creation, criticism, and recreation. I may not be an artist, but I know <del>what I like</del>what works. Even if I&#8217;m not able to construct the ideal thing that&#8217;s floating in my head, whatever I come up with is (hopefully) usable and visually appealing. When I come back to look at it later with a fresher mind, I&#8217;ll know what still needs to be done. Everything can always be better. Time and experience bring this philosophy to the forefront again and again.

This blog has gone through a few designs already in its young life. Nothing ever seems just right, so I keep trying new things. The current iteration is courtesy of [Alive Themes](http://www.alivethemes.com/). They call this particular theme **Deep Blue**. It&#8217;s cool, despite the blue really being more&#8230;warm. I suppose it relates to the deep blue of an ocean floor. The orange and gray contrast nicely. The design feels a bit **_heavy_**, in that it&#8217;s like you can feel the HTML and JS in the background weighing down the page just a little, slowing down the responsiveness. However, it&#8217;s good enough and I will work with it (at least until my wandering design ethic desires something new in the future (which it will)).

Normally, using a template is not my way. A developer and tinkerer are gonna want to make their own things, if feasible. I&#8217;ve surely made my own designs, including all of the HTML, CSS, and JS, so making a WordPress theme is not above my ability. Despite that realization, creating one from scratch is essentially like making a new website (minus the back-end logic), so it&#8217;s not something taken lightly. That&#8217;s why sometimes it&#8217;s better to let someone else tackle these things. When your site isn&#8217;t about making money or showing off your skills, and it&#8217;s just a place to put some thoughts, then I&#8217;m happy to handle the design reins over to someone else. At least, as a foundation. To be honest, I&#8217;ve already hacked this theme a bit to fix a bug and massage the layout to fit a wider-than-default logo because, well, it bugged me and needed to be done. I can&#8217;t stop every urge I have to fix things!

Templates are good ways to quickly get a nice-looking site up and running. There will always be drawbacks, though. In this case, the administration panel for the theme&#8217;s options locks many things down behind a paywall. Of course, if you know how themes work, you can get around this :-P The obvious conclusion of this kind of hacking through the back-door is a resounding &#8220;screw it, I&#8217;m going to roll my own.&#8221; That&#8217;s where my desire to make my own websites most likely came from originally. After going through the laborious process of making your own sites from scratch for several years, it&#8217;s nice to just grab a working copy without all of that labor. I&#8217;ll keep making my own sites from scratch when I want absolute control, but for this blog I think a template is the way to go for now.
