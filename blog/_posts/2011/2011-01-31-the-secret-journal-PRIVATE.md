In mid-November of 2002, a few months after the breakup of my first long-term (2 year+) relationship, I kind of imploded. And then I exploded. Which continued online. All over my LiveJournal.

I stopped LiveJournaling and I started a secret journal to keep the thoughts going, but privately. You could find it at journal.doc on my local computer&#8217;s hard drive, but it was _password-protected_. Good luck beating Microsoft Word security!

I just recently rediscovered this journal. Man. Times have changed.

I was really depressed, to say the least. My ex-girlfriend was constantly on my mind. We had actually started seeing each other again, doing this kinda-sorta-not-really relationship. It was a mistake, but at the time it was my only option and the masochism it was obviously generating was temporarily obscured by the pleasure of having a female companion again.

Unfortunately, the same overwhelmingly negative observations kept coming up: I feel alone, I don&#8217;t feel like my friends actually give a shit about me, I can&#8217;t trust my ex-girlfriend, I don&#8217;t think my ex-girlfriend actually cares about any of the things I care about, I really wish I could get a job, I&#8217;m so unmotivated to do anything and my life is pretty damn pointless. If I only Reddit had existed at the time and I knew of it!

Most of the entries still had a glimmer of hope, as I was a pessimistic optimist and all, but overall they were just individual windows into someone who had hit a personal rock bottom, stabbing at a text file with the vestiges of normalcy. Happiness was a goal (or was it?) that could never be attained, but was fought for mercilessly, even in the face of continued negativity.

The me back then was a sad sack. Of course, the demons inside that created that person still linger today. However, circumstances are ridiculously better so that the demons are kept at bay with ease. I have a job, I have a wife (!), and I even have a house. I have a steady group of friends that I don&#8217;t think merely tolerate me, but instead actually care about me, as I care about them. Any hardships that come my way now are not seen through the eyes of a single, completely aimless 22 year-old, but are filtered through Robyn and all that she has brought to my life. And that is a many splendored thing.

It seems hard to believe that I spent so much time back then obsessively dissecting relationships and beating myself up over one person. It was like a cancer, a disease, to be unable to enjoy anything because of that one person&#8217;s tacit, perceived disapproval. It&#8217;s not hard to believe, however, why a certain friend decided to distance themselves from me at the time. There was much fun sucked out of rooms because of my&#8230;_condition_ at the time. The way I finally exploded online is pretty damn embarrassing. The things I did in that state were messy and childish. I wouldn&#8217;t take them back, however, because that was me being honest and raw. It doesn&#8217;t, however, mean that I can&#8217;t try to not let that kind of thing happen again.

My life from late 2004 to now has sure been a major improvement, so I don&#8217;t see that being too difficult.
