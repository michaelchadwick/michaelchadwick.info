Sundays are the day for a new beginning.

\***

You may remember that we acquired a pooch almost 3 months ago. A 3 month-old, female, rough sable collie that we named Penny. You may also remember that after 2.5 days of absolute meltdown, we took her back to her original owner.

_Sigh_.

Not our proudest moment, for sure. A combination of lack of experience and anxious overwhelmingness drove us to a place not far outside of madness. We tried to take on a huge responsibility all by ourselves with oversensitive brains and failed hard. Our mind paralysis was absolute.

I remember the night before we were going to get back into the car and take this most likely frightened little baby back to her original home. I tried to take her on a walk to a grassy area in the middle of several rows of houses in our housing complex. She didn&#8217;t like leashes and would only walk and follow me without one, so after much frustration I gave up on restraining her and just hoped she wouldn&#8217;t run away. She didn&#8217;t.

She eventually followed me to the grassy area and we sat down on a bench in the middle. I quickly learned just how many other dogs existed in our neighborhood as I was soon surrounded by people and their pets. I introduced myself to a bunch of people I&#8217;d never met before, despite living there for 15 months. I met a bunch of dogs of all kinds. Penny didn&#8217;t bark, but she was definitely skittish and scared. I felt really popular. That popularity was tainted and short-lived, though. I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone that they would most likely never see Penny again. The moment was both blessed and cursed.

After returning home from Arizona a second time in a week the release of tension was immediate. Breathing became less labored and anxiety was extinguished. We both felt much better for weeks afterward. Perhaps we weren&#8217;t dog people, and it was better to realize this sooner than later. Being called by an obedience center to tell us we missed our first class stung, but it was better than the alternative.

However, a different feeling crept in once a month or so went by. The short-term relief was replaced by a marked decrease in Robyn&#8217;s confidence to take care of a dependent, pet _or_ kid. We&#8217;ve talked about kids many, many times, and we both vacillate heavily on when to pursue them. The longer we wait, the more selfish we get. Getting a dog seemed like a good &#8220;practice&#8221; baby, except we failed miserably at that. How could we handle an actual kid that you **can&#8217;t** (without some truly disastrous consequences) take back?

Time went on and that feeling grew stronger in Robyn and even started to seep into me. I didn&#8217;t really want a dog, but I also didn&#8217;t want to feel like having a kid was this insurmountable obstacle. The bad thing was that the absence of Penny, when I really stopped to think about it, felt exactly like that. Lots of people have dogs and lots of people have kids, many in our own neighborhood, and yet we couldn&#8217;t seem to handle it. What was wrong with us? Was it too late to change our habits and behaviors? Were we just too selfish and set in our ways? Just imagining the dog being around set off anxiety triggers. And yet, there were so many good aspects of having a dog: going on walks, taking her to work, getting bagels in the morning, playing fetch, meeting people, etc. The reality of the times when that _wasn&#8217;t_ what you were doing continued to cast a pall of panic over everything, however.

Left to my own devices, I would probably not do anything about it and just embrace bachelorhood. Robyn, on the other hand, hungered to get over this feeling, and finally decided to do something about it. I remained hesitant, but supportive.

Here we go again.

About three months and a week after that fateful August weekend, we&#8217;re back where we were, except&#8230;things are different. For one, Penny is still with us. As I sit and write this she is safe in her crate at home, most likely sleeping. We&#8217;ve got a dogsitter coming by in the middle of the day to take her out so she can stretch, go to the bathroom, and play a little. We&#8217;ve got an appointment to get her spayed at the end of the week. She likes, and goes manually to, her crate, which we have situated next to the TV in the living room. She doesn&#8217;t bark much and she doesn&#8217;t chew on too many things. She&#8217;s (almost) potty-trained. She seems happy and content when inside our house.

She&#8217;s fairly petrified of everything outside, however :-\ We&#8217;re working on that.

Overall, this time around has been much, much better than last time. What&#8217;s different? This time we <s>exploited</s>used family. Namely, Robyn&#8217;s parents, my mom, and Robyn&#8217;s brother and his girlfriend. Since it was Thanksgiving last week, Robyn decided it would be a good time to try again, as having a few extra people around to distract and entertain her was paramount to getting through the first few days. She drove out to Arizona with her parents, put Penny in the back of our Outback, and drove back to Anaheim with her. I used the days that she was in California, but not yet at our home, to collect my thoughts and do the kind of things I like to do when alone. It was kind of a bachelor party for one, but it was greatly needed. This little independent life, soon to be wandering around, not being able to communicate with us directly, requiring training (on both of our parts)&#8230;it&#8217;s a lot to add to one&#8217;s life when you&#8217;re not used to it. When they finally came down to our house the following Tuesday, I was anxious. You&#8217;re never quite ready for a change like this.

As can be seen by the picture above, she&#8217;s grown quite a bit. She acts pretty much like we remember her, but she&#8217;s much better about being on a leash, and going up and down our stairs. She won&#8217;t go down them as readily as she&#8217;ll go up them, but with a little nudge we can usually get her to climb down. She seems to understand &#8220;sit&#8221; quite well, and we&#8217;re working on &#8220;down&#8221;, &#8220;come&#8221;, and &#8220;stay&#8221;.

For the most part, she sits and lies around a lot. She doesn&#8217;t seem to like to do anything for more than a couple minutes, going from &#8220;let&#8217;s play!&#8221; to &#8220;I&#8217;m fine sitting here for a bit&#8221; in a moment&#8217;s notice. We wager she&#8217;s just not totally comfortable, having been taken (yet again) from a sandy, remote environment filled with lots of her own kind, to a semi-bustling suburban landscape, replete with cars, bikes, people, garbage trucks, and other dogs that aren&#8217;t like her. She&#8217;s taken to shaking a lot when we go too far from our house, obviously panic-stricken from being out of her comfort zone. She got away from us while we were testing a new, longer leash, and bolted straight for our house faster and faster as I ran to chase her. I was worried she&#8217;d wrap the leash around something and choke herself to death, but thankfully she just ran into an alcove between our house and the next, and pooped herself instead. The bath that came after that changed my very nature as a caretaker.

\***

The paralyzing interest in her well-being when we&#8217;re at home hasn&#8217;t exactly depleted, but it&#8217;ll get better. I&#8217;m hopeful instead of doubtful now. I can&#8217;t really imagine taking her back anymore, even while I feel my whole life has been upset and I find it near-impossible to &#8220;let go&#8221; and just let her be. Last week was very unusual for us, and this week is the first &#8220;real&#8221; week in that we go to work and then come home like usual, only we have a puppy who is happy to see us and needs to go outside and eat and be played with for a while. I&#8217;m still waiting for the other shoe to drop at night when we try to go to sleep, as I&#8217;m just **sure** she&#8217;s going to start whining, crying, or barking. Thus far, every night has been the same, and she&#8217;s been totally silent. Maybe she really has learned, and pretty quickly, that this her new routine, and we&#8217;re going to wake up in the morning and repeat it all over again.

Maybe we really have learned, a little more slowly than she, that this is _our_ new routine, too.
