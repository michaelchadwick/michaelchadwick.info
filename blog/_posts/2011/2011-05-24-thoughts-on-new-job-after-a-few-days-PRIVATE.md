I&#8217;ve been a full-time (again) web developer for a few days now. The ick factor of being a temp seems foreign and distant now (OK, not really, but that&#8217;ll end soon enough). Here&#8217;s what I think about it so far.

Overall, things are overwhelmingly positive. The building I work in has a security system, but I just wave a card and I can get through the doors I need to get through. All of the people seem fairly normal and nice and helpful, especially those who are on my specific team. The commute is a little worse in terms of traffic (I switched to a later schedule), but it&#8217;s shorter, so it averages out. Parking is now free and plentiful, and there&#8217;re tons of food options nearby (however, they can be busy during normal lunch hours). The cubicle I&#8217;m stationed at has nice furniture and there&#8217;s ample light and ventilation. My computer is speedy, and I continue to have dual monitors.

The actual work at this point has not been exceedingly difficult, as it&#8217;s largely knowledge transfer. I&#8217;ve sat down with a couple co-workers and picked their brains about where things are and the workflows required to make things happen. I&#8217;m not quite ready to make any changes to sites or assume full responsibility for anything, but I&#8217;m poking around here and there trying to familiarize myself with how things get done. I&#8217;ve even been to a meeting already (I don&#8217;t usually go to meetings much)! It&#8217;s a recurring one, and the people in it are fun, so I actually look forward to it.

One of the main developers is leaving soon, which royally sucks, because I won&#8217;t have the reliance to count on. Instead, I&#8217;ll probably subsume some responsibility in the coming months and have to teach it to the replacement person who eventually comes aboard.

One neat thing is that I may get to work on an iPhone app for the company, my first spearheaded project! It&#8217;s not a high priority and it&#8217;s currently vaporware, but I&#8217;ll be checking up on iOS development (again, for realsies this time).

Time will tell, as it always does, how well my sanity, seniority, and creative ambition fares as the days go by, but at this point I&#8217;m excited and happy.
