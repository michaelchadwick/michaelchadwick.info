A few weeks ago, I was feeling overwhelmed by social media. Namely, Facebook and Twitter. I love both technologies and think that it&#8217;s useful and neat to be able to quickly update the people we know about the things going on in our lives. Of course, with a certain number of friends, this &#8220;life status traffic&#8221; can overwhelm the signal-to-noise ratio (at least to me). I needed a break.

So I stopped checking both.

Initially, the withdrawal was significant. My phone seemed less useful, since it was the primary way of checking on both feeds multiple times a day. I kind of missed knowing what was going on. Still, the need subsided and life stayed largely the same. It didn&#8217;t make a big difference.

Earlier this week I started checking Twitter again, mainly out of a sense of curiosity, but also a sense of boredom. It felt good to be &#8220;home&#8221; again. I haven&#8217;t &#8220;gone back&#8221; to Facebook yet, though, but I know there are several people who use it and not Twitter, so I will probably return eventually.

What did I learn from all of this? One, that it&#8217;s good to take a break if you need it every once in a while. Two, that I lived without this source of &#8220;news&#8221; before and can again. Three, that Echofon is still far and away the best client for Twitter.

I wish this had been more enlightening, but it was not. Bah.
