I&#8217;ve been temping for almost two years now. The place that I temp won&#8217;t let me temp for more than two years. Once I reach my limit I&#8217;m required to essentially &#8220;retire&#8221; for several months. In other words, I&#8217;d be SOL.

Thankfully, that isn&#8217;t going to happen because I got a new job!

Of course, it&#8217;s with the same company and the same kind of work, but in a different building in a different location and in a different department (new boss, too). The best parts about it (from a purely practical/selfish standpoint) are that it&#8217;s closer to my home, it&#8217;s full-time, and there&#8217;s no charge to park nearby like my current position. There are all great things!

I start mid-next week after a day-long orientation that all new employees have to go through. Technically, I&#8217;m not a _new_ employee, but I&#8217;m a new _full-time_ employee, so I qualify for this. A physical had to be done, as well as a TB test I still need to check the status of tomorrow. Due to some unforseen red tape, I may have to go back for a drug test, as well, but if so my reward is actually getting Friday off.

\***

This is a big load off my mind, and off my wife&#8217;s mind. We have some money saved up in case of catastrophic employment loss, but this is far more ideal. Temping was a good way to get in, but I&#8217;m very happy to be turning into a full employee. Stability is one of those things that just makes all other aspects of your life that much better.
