Something I used to do everyday for hours without even thinking about it now is something I have to consciously schedule time for. Yes, I&#8217;ve been playing guitar for about 15 years now, and yes I&#8217;m married and own a home. None of those are excuses to not practice, though. No, the boring truth is that my talent peaked a while ago, and my creative ideas are more sparse and are often funneled elsewhere. Instead of something I initially binged on, losing myself in the art, playing the guitar is just something I do occasionally now, and I&#8217;m really just largely _known for having played it_ more than actively plucking the strings.

This makes me sad.

However, a training stint at work a couple weeks ago allowed me to go into the office later than usual. With about an hour each morning of consciousness that wasn&#8217;t filled with watching Let&#8217;s Play videos while eating yogurt and drinking coffee, I turned to my trusty first acoustic guitar, Big Red, and the iPhone&#8217;s Voice Memos app. At one point, I even broke out my electric guitar and amp and noodled around, just like the old days. The former made my hands hurt more than I remember them doing in the past, but the latter felt free and easy. I&#8217;ve had roughly the same instruments, amps, and effects for over a decade, so I get sick of the same ol&#8217; sound as it ends up existing on a recording, but when I&#8217;m playing live, it&#8217;s all good.

It felt good to just play, man.

I played old Nebyoolae songs. I played Pure Yellow Colour. I played pop and rock songs I&#8217;ve played countless times before. I just played. The physical act of strumming a guitar continues to calm the savage beast. It gets my mind going and makes me wish I had actually written something in the last 8 months. Maybe I will. Who knows? I&#8217;m fickle and I jump from creative project to creative project much too often, so it&#8217;s impossible to tell.

Regardless of when the next time I actually release some new music, I&#8217;m going to try to play at least a few times a week. I may be pushing 31 now, but I&#8217;m gonna keep the rock alive.
