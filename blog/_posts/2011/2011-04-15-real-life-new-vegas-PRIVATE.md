Fallout: New Vegas is sublime, in a tense, precarious way. Exploring the desert&#8217;s wonders while simultaneously fearing for your life is a pastime I enjoy. Much like its predecessor Fallout 3, F:NV is loosely inspired by an actual area of the USA, namely Las Vegas, NV. Lots of the places in-game exist in real life, only modified to represent themselves post-nuke. Trudging around F:NV&#8217;s wasteland, in a disproportionate and black humorous way, is almost like visiting the real thing, only armed with more Rad-X and Power Fists.

In fact, to prove this point, a rather commendable bloke did a good deed and visited a bunch of the places mentioned in the game, photographing landmarks, to get a side-by-side comparison. It&#8217;s fascinating reading, and very interesting to find out how detailed Obsidian got as they modeled their post-apocalyptic hellscape.
