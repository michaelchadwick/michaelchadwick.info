<a rel="attachment wp-att-4624" href="http://blog.nebyoolae.com/2011/04/02/4621/mbp_box"></a>It&#8217;s fairly common knowledge that Apple &#8220;overprices&#8221; things. That is, when you look at similarly specced computers from them and a typical PC dealer, Apple always tends to be higher. Those of us who use their products know about this and have accepted it, mainly because we like their products and are willing to pony up extra cash to have them. The easily replaceable components of their computers, however, _not so much_.

One component most people fixate on is memory. And we can all agree that Apple **reaaaaally** overprices their RAM. Thus, when I ordered my new MacBook Pro (and my old MacBook), I went with the default amount, knowing I&#8217;d upgrade it later for cheaper ($100 less expensive, in fact). I just recently ordered the RAM and it came in yesterday. Since I had already taken apart my old MB to upgrade it with no problems, so I figured this one wouldn&#8217;t be too hard. It wasn&#8217;t.

You flip it over, take out about a dozen Phillips screws, some long and most short, pry the cover off, and bam. You are now looking at the exciting insides of your expensive computer. The RAM is situated in the middle. I just pushed on the sides of the contraption holding them in and slipped the modules out. Easy as pie. I got the new ones out of their protective plastic containers and reversed the process.

With the new RAM in, I replaced the cover and screws, flipped it back over, and turned it back on. That reassuring Apple startup sound meant I had least done something _not horribly wrong_, and the desktop came up as quickly as ever. About This Mac for the win!

Since we all know that RAM doesn&#8217;t make your computer faster, but merely delays the journey to using the much slower hard drive as swap space instead of fast memory, my Mac doesn&#8217;t actually feel faster yet. However, when I go to try loading Logic Pro and a bunch of plugins/samples, I&#8217;m hoping it will not give me any more accursed &#8220;out of memory&#8221; issues, and maybe be a bit snappier than before.

Other than memory, a hard drive upgrade is all I can ever see improving on this machine. It&#8217;s got a 5400 RPM 500 GB drive, which is fine for my purposes. However, I&#8217;ve been hearing all the rage about SSDs lately, and as soon as a decent 256GB drive that isn&#8217;t $TEXAS comes out, I&#8217;ll probably jump on that. Until then, I&#8217;m gonna relish the extra memory breathing room I&#8217;ve created.
