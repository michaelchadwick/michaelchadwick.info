A well-done Scorched Earth/Gorillas/Angry Birds kind of power+angle tossing game. The first few worlds were pretty easy, but Atlantis has been stumping me regularly.

Lead the trains along a grid to get to their respective stations. Graphical style is gorgeous. The puzzles start out stupid-easy, but gently ramp up to some true Puzzleby von Whatenstein-level difficulty.

[**Mind Wall**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mind-wall-universal/id320170750?mt=8)
From the makers of [Dungeon Scroll](http://itunes.apple.com/app/dungeon-scroll/id325330886?mt=8) (an awesome old-school dungeon crawler via Boggle), Mind Wall is an game that&#8217;s really more of an intelligence test masquerading as one. You have to fit the varied shapes that drop slowly toward a wall into the one place that it can safely fit. The multiplayer modes keep this on my phone past the initial somewhat short singleplayer mode.
