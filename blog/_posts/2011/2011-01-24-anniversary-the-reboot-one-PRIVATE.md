Getting married and having a traditional, reasonably-sized wedding with a considerable number of people still suits me as a wonderful idea. Sure, in the end, it&#8217;s a piece of paper and a proclamation. But I still place value in it. And I still place value in the memories it helped create.

Robyn and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this weekend. Our actual dating anniversary is today, and it is our sixth. Robyn&#8217;s parents came down on Saturday and took us out for a celebratory dinner at the same place we went to for our rehearsal dinner. We got to eat great food. We got to eat it way earlier than we did at our rehearsal dinner (after 9pm). The waiter and owner remembered us and we all got to feel like rock stars for a few hours.

On our actual wedding anniversary, we got some sandwiches and drove to where we got married. There was a lot less hubbub this time. No throng of people, no makeup room, no walking down an aisle, and no picture taking. Just Robyn and me, and the memories.

Perched on the second floor, looking out at the ocean and the valiant attempts of surfers to ride some sub-standard waves, I got that infinite feeling. I know that way out there, miles and miles and miles beyond the horizon, was civilization. I couldn&#8217;t see that civilization with my naked eyes, though. All I could touch was the food I was eating, the ground below me, and the wall behind me. The weather was perfect, just like it had been on our wedding day. Of course, it&#8217;s not difficult for San Diego to churn out 72 with clear, blue skies, but after the marked precipitation of January 2010, this was a bit of a relief.

We finished our food as we reminisced a bit. Then we got up and walked around the front of the forum. People strolled along the beach, palm trees sashayed, and the love between husband and wife was as strong on day 365 as it was on day 1. It&#8217;s unfortunate that our six years together today is now overshadowed by our one year together as a married couple. All that time swallowed up by that piece of paper. I still wouldn&#8217;t trade it away for anything.
