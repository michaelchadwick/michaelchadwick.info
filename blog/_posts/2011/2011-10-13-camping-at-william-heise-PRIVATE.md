My wife and I _finally_ got around to going camping last weekend; it was something we&#8217;ve been wanting to do again for many years. A bunch of friends joined us up at William Heise County Park in Julian, CA, a wonderful little spot nestled deep within the windy roads about an hour or so north of our house. We&#8217;d been here about 5-6 years ago with just two other friends. This time, we were going to have five additional adults, including a 7 month-old baby, and a 2 year-old toddler. That&#8217;d be a grand total of 11 human beings; the max on our spot was 8. So, yeah. Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t a problem.

**99! 99! 99!** Visions of senior year high school pep rallies come to mind all of a sudden.

Our newly-purchased [2011 Subaru Outback](http://blog.nebyoolae.com/my-first-our-car-the-subaru-outback/) worked out really well. We were able to get several crates of supplies, sleeping bags, a tent, cots, a tarp, some backpacks, a couple coolers, and various other sundries, and still get 3 people in comfortably. I doubt I&#8217;d be able to accomplish that in my old Saturn Ion. Our friend Josh and we arrived at the campsite early enough to get all our sleeping arrangement squared away before night fall, so we were able to help everyone else set their stuff up once they got there.

Sleeping in a tent on an air mattress, while fully-clothed and in a sleeping bag, in 40 degree weather is a far cry from our warm and inviting bed back at home. However, we braved the nights and had a great weekend, too. There was lots of food prepared and eaten, including beans and weenies, breakfast sandwiches, tacos, pie, coffee, and (of course) smores. We chatted and played some nerd party games at night, all the while warming ourselves by the ever-crackling fire. It was really nice.

The neighboring campers were all nice, and one of them had a lively evening on Saturday tossing all matter of things into their fire, trying to <del>start a forest fire</del>make it as magnanimous as possible. We also went on a semi-grueling, but invigorating, hike at one point, and I unfortunately fell, tweaking my left wrist and tearing a hole in my jeans. That was not so nice. All in all, though, I think it was successful and people enjoyed themselves. Everyone pitched in to help on all accounts and things went smoothly.

The next time I go camping, however, I will definitely try to **not also be on-call for work**. I got an early morning support request, as well as a couple later in the day. That didn&#8217;t rule. I was having issues connecting to things and I didn&#8217;t know how to figure out the issues presented, so I had to contact my boss, which you usually hope to be your last resort. I guess you could say it was a little trial by fire when I least wanted it. It threatened to ruin the weekend when it really shouldn&#8217;t have been an issue, so I know now to do things differently in the future.

I&#8217;m kind of excited to go camping again someday soon, and not in another half-decade. Maybe Yosemite?
