**WORLD OF ADDICTCRAFT**

I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of World of Warcraft. In fact, after hitting 60 on my current main with Robyn (she hit 60, too), we were left with a hollow feeling, no longer seeing that wonderful &#8220;XP&#8221; gain message when doing something that usually nets you some. Thus, with a boat load of Gamestop credit and some spare cash I&#8217;d been socking away for a Rock Band Fender Strat (Rock Band has not been on my radar for months, unfortunately), we purchased all three expansions, times 2. It was a lot of money, but it was essentially &#8220;free,&#8221; as all money was gained via selling old gaming software to Gamestop. I was just returning the favor, really.

Two words come to mind after venturing back into Azeroth, now with 3 serial numbers successfully entered: **flying mount**. OMG how much nicer the game is to play once you&#8217;re able to just. fly. ANYWHERE. No slowly riding around hills or slowly swimming through water for us. Sure there&#8217;re raised level caps, new dungeons, and new races to try out, but nothing compares to the power of flight, homes.

Josh says the journey from 60-85 is a bit rougher than 1-60. I still think we&#8217;ll prevail, regardless.

**TINY WINGS**

This is my current love/hate iPhone addiction. The game employs a fairly simple mechanic, sweetened by cute graphics and sound, that&#8217;s a joy to play. Each day the landscape changes and so it&#8217;s worth trying out for a few minutes no matter what. Unfortunately, the latest batch of objectives to complete has me stymied. I have reached Island 9, but I cannot clear Island 4 in fever mode nor hit 20 cloud taps while not in fever mode. I&#8217;ve tried so many times, and with each failure I feel the blood pressure rising and the desire to violently hurl my iPhone away from my person. It&#8217;s getting to the point where this seemingly endless frustration has me fancying a total deletion of the app due to its harmful effects.

And yet, it stays. And yet, I continue playing.

**FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS**

Yes, I already completed this one. However, there is DLC I haven&#8217;t tried, aaaaaaand since it&#8217;s been so long since I last played, I felt the need to start over and try a new build. Instead of the normal run-and-gun approach, I&#8217;m going the melee/sneak route. This goes against every strategy I usually employ, mainly due to its ineffectiveness/inefficiency. Still, I&#8217;m gonna give it a real go this time&#8230;until I give up on it. Regardless, I love the storyline and the environment. Like World of Warcraft, it&#8217;s a place I simply want to visit and revisit time and time again, even if to just hang out for a little bit each time.
