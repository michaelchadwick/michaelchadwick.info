It&#8217;d be nice if I were good at blogging. What do I mean by that? I mean that I wish I had one particular theme per blog post. One, it&#8217;s easier to look up stuff later, and two, it&#8217;s good to focus so that my main sites&#8217; RSS filter was more accurate when it grabs anything I&#8217;ve either marked with &#8220;web development&#8221; or &#8220;music&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m required to leave both off because this is such a smorgasbord of an entry. Oh, well.

Let&#8217;s see what I&#8217;ve been up to lately:

* **Work**: had a big meeting recently with my boss so I feel like we&#8217;re both caught up on things. That makes me feel good.
* **Books**: read some [Wil Wheaton](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/). That guy is a good writer, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy about family and stuff.
* **Games**: simultaneously playing through both [Breath of Death VII](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802585504bd) and [Cthulhu Saves the World](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Cthulhu-Saves-the-World/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258550756) on XBox Live&#8217;s Indie Game section. They&#8217;re like jumping back into the late 1980s and replaying Dragon Warrior _N_.
* **Movies**: saw Time-Traveler&#8217;s Wife. Better than your average chick-flick. Also saw Gantz, the live-action film. It was&#8230;the raddest bad movie I&#8217;ve seen in a while.
* **House**: nothing much. Still enjoying our masterful paint job, warts and all.
* **Robyn**: celebrated 1 year together as a married couple. The 1 year-and-three-days is pretty keen, too!
* **Exercise**: in my attempt to catch up with Robyn, who is now running 3x a week, my friend and I started playing racquetball again. We had stopped due to the court being closed for several weeks, but are now back on once a week. Otherwise, I started playing DDR again, as well. My skill has lessened significantly.
* **Programming**: a little burnt out, as I&#8217;ve been OCDing all over my web development projects lately. The massive overhaul of [nebyooweb.com](http://nebyooweb.com) still needs some tweaking, as does [nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com), but I&#8217;m loathe to work on it right now. Still need to actually start work on my Ruby on Rails project. Almost done with the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
* **Vanity**: my hair has gotten quite long (for me). It&#8217;s currently at the point of &#8220;this is too long and annoying, I should cut it&#8221;, but also nearing the &#8220;huh, I wonder what it would be like to have long-ish hair for a while&#8221; point.

That&#8217;s about it.
