I walked to a familiar area&#8230;and then pushed on past it to a somewhat less than familiar area. I broke from an obvious path to reach a clearing along a different path. Staring into, and across, the abyss can change your perspective a bit. Surveying the land, I took some pictures. Although it seemed like a secret place, a break in the plants and trees that was somehow remote, I&#8217;m sure many had trod there before. No matter! I was there now, and I was alone.Â Making my way back to the familiar lead me down yet another new path. The sun started to make me perspire, due to all the extra footwork. Eventually I returned to a well-worn road and I made my way back to where I began my trek.

All in all it was a fun jaunt. I got some exercise and I saw some things I hadn&#8217;t seen before. This need to &#8220;get away&#8221; and ignore the standard boundaries and restrictions wells up inside me sporadically, and this is how I process it. Nothing has really changed, and I reached no epiphanies, but I do feel a little energized&#8230;resuscitated, even.

Go on an adventure today, big or small. You&#8217;ll probably be glad you did.
