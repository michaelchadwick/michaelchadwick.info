**AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR**
It&#8217;s finally here. It&#8217;s the ninth of September, year 2009 of our Lord. That means, in American numerical date format, it&#8217;s 09/09/09. All this Beatlemania rebrewing can finally runneth over its cup. Hopefully, when we get home tonight, a huge box will be waiting for us.

**PIES**
My feet hurt. Some combination of wearing nice shoes to work for the past 6 weeks and playing DDR that one time and playing racquetball barefoot yesterday afternoon has given me a set of tender tootsies.

**TRABAJO**
My work on the website has been less focused, mainly due to two things: 1) It feels like it&#8217;s coming to a stopping point, and 2) there&#8217;s some other department starting to enforce uniformity on both external and internal websites (mine&#8217;s intranet) and they say _they&#8217;re_ the ones to do the initial design (making a lot of my work pointless). We had a meeting last week about it that was eye-opening for our department and made me feel kind of useless. All of this makes me feel kind of meh.

Today, we start work on building a new server for the database system they use here, something that doesn&#8217;t exactly enthrall me, especially since I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to be doing to help out just yet.

Overall, I&#8217;ve found a niche to inhabit here, but I feel like that niche could change at any moment.

**PAJARO**
It occurs to me, out of the blue, it would seem, that I&#8217;m getting married. I look at Facebook and see &#8220;Robyn Daly is engaged to Michael Chadwick&#8221; and I do a mini double-take. Or I glance at her left hand. Or it comes up in conversation with someone. It all makes me very happy inside, though, and very lucky to be where I am in life.

**FOR THE ROAD**
I heard at least one peep got swine flu at PAX this year. Kind of makes me OK with not having gone.
