I&#8217;m seriously considering moving away from the LiveJournal &#8220;platform&#8221; for my blogging needs. Since the community that was once here doesn&#8217;t feel like it exists anymore, this probably won&#8217;t affect anything. By community, I&#8217;m referring to the people on my friends list, a significant amount of which do not post anymore or leave comments. This includes me. This causes me to check the site infrequently for any locked posts that don&#8217;t get through my public-only RSS feed.

Also, I haven&#8217;t been a paying member for a while, so I see a lot of ads. The one that pops up once a day and obscures the whole page is particularly egregious. I could start paying again, but I don&#8217;t want to.

My options are to start a blog on some other major blogging website, like Tumblr or BlogSpot or WhatHaveYou, put a WordPress blog on nebyoolae.com, or just start using the blog that&#8217;s already on there as more than just a way to promote my music and related minutiae. All of these options would move me away from LiveJournal for good, would be free, and would are in order of increasing ease. I&#8217;m not sure which I&#8217;ll choose, but I&#8217;ll choose one of them.

Saying goodbye to an online community feels a little preposterous, especially in its waning days (as far as use in my friend circle goes), so I&#8217;m just gonna skip that. Suffice it to say, without LiveJournal I don&#8217;t think I would have ever started recording my life regularly, created or rekindled some great friendships, nor even maybe have met my wonderful, loving wife. Missing those elements of my life would be completely disastrous.

So, thanks LiveJournal. And so long.
