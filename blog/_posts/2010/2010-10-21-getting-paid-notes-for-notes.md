It&#8217;s still really amazing when I get paid for doing music. Something I started doing back in high school for fun now has come in handy for producing some kind of sporadic income multiple times.

Not that the amount paid is anywhere close to the amount needed to live off of, of course, but it is effectively non-zero. Still, it&#8217;s a surreal feeling to play/record music and then be given money for its performance/recording. Part of me always feels like I&#8217;m not &#8220;good enough&#8221; to be worthy of payment. Part of me even feels like perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;selling out&#8221; in such a way, diluting the artistic integrity of making desired patterned air movements.

Most of me just feels lucky that I can use my talents to gain currency to purchase things that can be used to further the use of my talents.
