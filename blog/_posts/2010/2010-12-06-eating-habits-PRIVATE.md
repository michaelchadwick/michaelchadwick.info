Even though it would be more cost-effective, I enjoy purchasing food at work rather than bringing it.

Part of my morning routine that I enjoy is tempering the blah feeling I have of getting up early and then walking into my office by making a &#8220;pit stop&#8221; of sorts at the nearby cafeteria. I&#8217;m at work, in a sense, but still not _at_ work yet. Smelling the brewing coffee and pastries helps start my day.

Lunch is a far better example, however, because it&#8217;s a big 30-45 minute break of bliss. Temporarily mitigating the adverse effect of staring at a screen for 5 hours straight is just the beginning of what&#8217;s great about it. Currently, lunch consists of walking for about 5 minutes to a nearby cafeteria (not the one for breakfast), talking to the guy running the register for about 10 seconds while I order food, waiting for a few minutes, grabbing my food from a counter and then quietly sitting inside (or something outside) while I eat and read my iPhone or a weekly news publication. I don&#8217;t talk to anyone and I can do what I want without any guilt or real distraction. A lot of people would see this as anti-social (&#8220;why doesn&#8217;t he ever talk to anyone?&#8221;) or sad (&#8220;awww, he&#8217;s all alone&#8221;), but in reality it&#8217;s just me being me. That is, enjoying a peaceful, contented period of time by myself, not needing to interact and efficiently consuming nourishment. It&#8217;s the best part of the day, really.

Of course, this all means I spend about $10 a day, 5/7 days a week. The food isn&#8217;t very healthy, either (although I could be better about what I choose). I have mixed feelings about &#8220;letting go&#8221; like this, both health-wise and money-wise. Part of me just enjoys it because it&#8217;s enjoyable, doesn&#8217;t require me to think about food before leaving for work, and is a tradition of sorts I&#8217;ve developed. Part of me feels guilty because it&#8217;s not good for me and I could save money by taking my lunch, which is what I&#8217;d probably **have** to do if we had a child to support.

As usual there is no conclusion or lesson learned, and I&#8217;ll go on forever feeling conflicted. Most things in life are like this for me. The observation has now been made, though. And for that, there is some solace.
