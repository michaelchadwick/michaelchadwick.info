**AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR**
Happy Birthday to those of you who are celebrating one today, plus or minus 364 days.

**THE RIGHT HONORABLE CHADWICK**
So, it&#8217;s been over two months since I got married. Anything different? No, not really. I&#8217;m in love with my wife, however. Wife. It&#8217;s a word that is hard to process as being apart of my personal vocabulary still. Seeing her name with my last name in places (or more astonishly so, _spoken_) is just&#8230;buh? I don&#8217;t know how to comprehend it, mang.

Sometimes, I just stop, to take stock of things and all, and realize where I am in life. I&#8217;m about to move into a house I will own (in 30 years) with my wife and I&#8217;m (only?) 29. Huh.

**THE HOUSE THAT STANDARD PACIFIC BUILT**
Speaking of housing, our house is almost done being constructed. We go each Saturday to check on its progress, and I have to admit it&#8217;s pretty cool to see it come together. I&#8217;m still of the &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s real until it&#8217;s done&#8221; frame of mind, so my real excitement and acceptance of the reality will happen on June 2 when we&#8217;re handed the keys to the castle.

I&#8217;m still not entirely sure about living in Santee. It&#8217;s further away from everything, it&#8217;s probably gonna be hotter, and it&#8217;s just not as familiar. Yet. However, I&#8217;ve gotten past the &#8220;What if?&#8221; and &#8220;What about?&#8221;-ness of it all and am just looking forward to adapting to my new lifestyle. Doubts and wonderments creep into my mind from time to time, but there&#8217;s no better way to move on except to, well, move on.

**CASH MONEY, FOOLS**
The house is step two in the Big Life Situation for me. One was getting married. Three will be kids. We talk about it more and more, and seeing many of our friends bring new life into the world is really hard to ignore. I&#8217;d be remiss if I said the potent combination of female biology and tribal expectation doesn&#8217;t color my thoughts on the matter. At times, it feels right, and at others I&#8217;m just not sold on the idea yet. I&#8217;m mentally ready for a child, I think, but being financially set to shoulder the responsibility still feels elusive.

We&#8217;ve worked out numbers and it always tends to look bleak in my mind. Expenses seem to overwhelm income. My lavish lifestyle of buying lunch at work everyday and having an expensive cable TV package and buying video games and musical stuff whenever I want doesn&#8217;t seem to coexist with diapers and daycare. Not having any family nearby (let alone knowing they&#8217;d be interested in providing free daycare) has never seemed like a liability until now.

It hasn&#8217;t stopped us from, at the very least, trying to pick out names, though. I still like Elizabeth for a girl and Landon for a boy, and she likes Madel(i/ei)ne for a girl and Julian for a boy. I figure that kind of decision happens after the baby is in the belly, though.

**HERE WE ARE NOW, ENTERTAIN US**
In Things I Do To Kill Time Until Death news, I&#8217;m smitten with Just Cause 2. For several weeks I&#8217;ve been playing it almost every night. It&#8217;s an open-world sandbox action thinger, except it&#8217;s better than yours because it has a grappling hook, unlimited parachutes, and the ability to chain a dude to a rocket and then send him soaring into the statosphere. It also has all the same trappings of an open-world game, which is to say there are tons of collectibles and tons of missions and tons of places to go and counters to keep track of them all so you know how much more stuff you have yet to do.

The latest novel I read was&#8230;oh wait. I don&#8217;t read.

As far as musicking goes, I&#8217;m kind of at a standstill while Just Cause 2 eats up my life. I made some improvements to my opus (a.k.a. _Dumeh_), and I downloaded some new samples to make it sound better. I still don&#8217;t have any ideas for videos to go along with any of _The Matic_&#8216;s pieces, so that sits untouched. I have some ideas for video game remixes that I&#8217;ve gathered into a collection I call &#8220;Gamey Mixture&#8221; but I don&#8217;t have any demos even close to done yet.

**WORKING FOR THE MASTER**
I continue to be a temp at my job, which isn&#8217;t necessarily good or bad. When you&#8217;re about to enter into a contract where hundreds of thousands of dollars are to exchange hands over many, many years, the stability of your job seems more pertinent, though.

Either way, I still feel like I&#8217;ve felt at every job I&#8217;ve ever had: I found yet another cool place that is (fairly) relaxed and flexible and I don&#8217;t feel stressed much at all, but I also feel really ancillary. I came to the conclusion that being a web developer is often gonna feel like that if the company itself doesn&#8217;t make money off the web development you do. I&#8217;m once again merely marketing or support, not sales. I&#8217;m still not that excited about what I do, and I still don&#8217;t feel like anything I do is worth talking about to other people.

The worst part of it is I feel ashamed because what I do is something no one else here really does, and they probably don&#8217;t understand what I do all day, either. And yet I get paid all the same. The cognitive dissonance with this situation makes me feel guilty because I feel like I&#8217;m just a nerdy expendable. I don&#8217;t do the grunt work that gets shit done. I do stuff that&#8217;s &#8220;nice to have&#8221; and my deadlines fall away all the time to the point where I don&#8217;t feel like I have any. This makes me lazy and sloppy. Instead of basking in the glory of a job well-done that is then shared with others, I hide. I do everything it takes to be unnoticed. My back corner cubicle is a sanctuary I only exit to pee, eat, and leave. Each day I feel is another anomaly of the economic system that keeps me employed and fed and clothed, but could disappear at any moment.

But it&#8217;s allllllllll good, right? Right?

**FOR THE ROAD**
It&#8217;s days like this that I call a &#8220;tedious slog through mediocrity.&#8221;
