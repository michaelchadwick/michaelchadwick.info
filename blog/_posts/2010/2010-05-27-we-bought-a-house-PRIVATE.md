And we get our keys in less than 12 hours. WHOA.

Tomorrow and Saturday is going to be for moving smaller, car-sized loads. And we&#8217;ve got plenty of boxes and things that fit that bill, so we&#8217;re gonna be busy.

Sunday is the Big Stuff moving day. We&#8217;re getting a truck and moving things like the couch and bed.

Monday is for overseeing some peeps who will clean our current abode. Then we turn the keys in.

And that will be that. New era begins Tuesday, people.
