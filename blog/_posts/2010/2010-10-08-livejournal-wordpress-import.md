Whomever actually wrote the [LiveJournal Import tool](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/livejournal-importer/) is a godsend. Instead of this blog starting out with one wimpy little &#8220;HEY GUYS&#8221; post, it&#8217;s already stacked with over EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ENTRIES.

Now, LiveJournal said I had over 2100 posts, so I&#8217;m kind of worried about which ones got left behind. On the other hand, I started blogging in LJ in the year 2 thousand and one, and I&#8217;m sure whatever it didn&#8217;t grab was just angsty geek crap that I won&#8217;t miss. Life is much different now than it was then (and yet, oddly enough, similar enough to make an angsty geek post about someday), and I probably won&#8217;t miss them.

Still, the import tool is magnificent. Guys! It even got all the comments and (seemed to) thread them correctly! That&#8217;s some thorough dedication right there.

Also, it grabbed all the NebyooBlog entries by just uploading its RSS feed. Data moving between systems so easily&#8230;it&#8217;s not natural. OR IS IT?

The all-in-one Mega Blog of Supremacy continues to come together&#8230;
