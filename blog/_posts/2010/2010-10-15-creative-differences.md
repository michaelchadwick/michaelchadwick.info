I&#8217;ve always thought as myself as someone who can get along with just about anyone. Lots of things annoy me just like anyone else, but I&#8217;m pretty good at staying quiet and/or just letting it ride despite any misgivings I may have.

I&#8217;ve also always thought of myself as a decent singer. Not a good, or even great, one, but decent. This means I&#8217;m not tone deaf, I can sing along with stuff, and I can hear melodies in things. This all comes from feeling like I have a gift at music, in that I comprehend it most of the time, can create it, can play it, and can share it with someone else.

Unfortunately, being _only_ a decent singer means not always getting along with someone else, no matter how good you think you are at either of those tasks.

When I sing, I hear myself. I hear this limited area around my ears where my voice has traveled. It gets loud. I can&#8217;t always hear other things well when I&#8217;m singing, including someone else&#8217;s voice. I&#8217;ve been told I try too hard a lot. This&#8230;never really does an adequate job of either stroking my ego or helping me improve at singing, which is not something I actively seek to improve, but would not mind being &#8220;better&#8221; at in order to add to my musical endeavors. Regardless, it&#8217;s frustrating to hear time and time again, mainly because I can&#8217;t hear the issue. Of course, I&#8217;ve recorded myself and can hear my weaknesses. But in real-time, I just hear my voice, doing a decent job of hitting notes and, sometimes, harmonizing with another. However, more often than not, it just becomes a burden for others, either practically or enjoyably. In the end, it&#8217;s usually easier for all parties involved if I just sing at a very low volume, like _**in my head**_.

Sigh. It sucks wanting to be good at something you&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s worse believing you&#8217;re better at something that you&#8217;re actually worse at than you think.
