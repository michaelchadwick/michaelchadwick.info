An emigrant from LiveJournal, where I was happily blogging for several years, I have finally made the jump to personal domain blogging. I have 7+ years of LiveJournal entries to import, but that will have to wait for now.

Unlike the blog at [nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com), this blog will be more personal in nature and discuss things in a non-music-promotional-only manner. Ever since Twitter and Facebook Status Updates, long-form macro-blogging has been at a premium, losing the battle to micro-blogging quite handedly. Although the micro-blogging will most likely persist, I&#8217;m going to make a concerted effort to get back into the swing of things on the long-form end, especially because I like reading others&#8217; forays into this form of communication as well.

Here&#8217;s to a reignited, rekindled, and reimagined blogging experience! /gag

Also, the name of the blog comes from a song I wrote, entitled [Lazy in the Park](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/206 "Lazy in the Park").
