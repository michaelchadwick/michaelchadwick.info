I love our house. In the summer, for the most part, the insulation kept the inside cool despite it being cold outside. When it didn&#8217;t do a good enough job, or it was simply too hot outside, we used the air conditioner.

Well, it&#8217;s officially fall now. And it&#8217;s gotten pretty cold outside. Apparently, it was 36 degrees this morning. Our house has been in the low 60s, and&#8230;well, that&#8217;s still kind of cold. Both Robyn and I are exclaiming every five minutes of the frigid climate within our walls. We&#8217;re both wearing long pants and several layers on top. Our extremities are not happy. Time to turn on the heater, right?

If my IRC commands didn&#8217;t clue you in, our heater doesn&#8217;t seem to be working. This is the first time we&#8217;ve tried to use it and so we have no previous experience to fall back on. It remains cold in the house. Thankfully, we have a warranty on everything for a year so we called in a service request and someone&#8217;s gonna investigate in a couple days. I&#8217;m really gonna miss this level of service come June of next year.

Until then, we continue to exclaim about the cold. Robyn&#8217;s gonna bake cookies just as an excuse to have the oven on. This idea, I cannot argue with, as it is absolute foolishness.

&#8212;

ALSO: It&#8217;s the end of NaBloPoMo. Except for some slacking on weekends, both Robyn and I have blogged at least once a day for an entire month. Go us! Now, let&#8217;s see if this keeps up.
