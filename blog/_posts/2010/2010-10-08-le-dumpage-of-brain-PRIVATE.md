**HOUSE LIFE**
The last time I wrapped at ya I went into some of the observations about living in our new house. In general, things are still swell and routine has set in like one would predict. Sights and sounds are all pretty normal and I can&#8217;t think of any one thing that stands out as either good or bad.

We&#8217;ve gotten to know the neighbor previously mentioned a bit better. The couple and their kids are nice and we&#8217;ve chatted with them a few times. Other than that, we haven&#8217;t really talked to any other neighbors, mainly due to making no effort to seek them out and rarely seeing them in the common areas.

Three new additions to the house of note are: 1) pictures (mainly wedding) all over the living room, 2) a dwarf lemon tree and basil plant, and 3) a newly bluish-purpley-gray 2nd floor guest bathroom. Due to some prodding from the in-laws, we decorated a bit more and now look like we are not ashamed that our wedding day occurred. The plants are an experiment to detect the existence of green thumbs, as well as get some cheap fruits and herbs. The decision to paint our house is made, but we wanted to attempt a shade in a small area first, for testing purposes (our amateurish job notwithstanding, it brought mixed results).

I love our place, even if I don&#8217;t love its location (far from stuff), and being able to improve it is cool.

**TRAVEL**
Robyn&#8217;s family graciously invited me on yet another cruise recently. This time we toured a few ports in Alaska. While not having the history and fame of cruising around the Mediterranean to see grand places like Athens and Cairo, the crisp mountain air, sprawling pine tree forests, and impressive glaciers were all significant sites to behold. Each time we pulled up into a port was a pleasurable experience just to see the cute, little coastal towns riding the edges of Southeastern Alaska. Unfortunately, going in early August, we didn&#8217;t experience snow (except far away atop mountains in the distance or as part of a glacier), let alone see much wild life. The scenic private van tours we took in two ports were fun and informational due to local guides who obviously knew Alaska better than us. Eating a four-course meal every night on a cruise ship is to be missed in spirit, if not in waistline, too.

It&#8217;s awesome to be able to say I&#8217;ve been to Alaska (and Canada, for a short transitional period), and to now have pictures to prove it. Check out [Picasaweb](http://picasaweb.google.com/michael.chadwick/2010AlaskanCruise) for the gallery, and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R28DF5AagN0) for the music video I made of the trip.

**MUSICVIDEO**
[YouTube](http://youtube.com/nebyoolae) has been my friend as of late. Instead of updating nebyoolae.com with new music, I updated YouTube every couple weeks or so with a new music _video_. My thought process was thus: people want visuals. I can hype a piece of music I wrote and uploaded until I&#8217;m blue in the face, but it&#8217;s just not as impressive and accessible as having something to **watch** at the same time, especially since the music itself is usually instrumental only. Plus, YouTube has nice statistics to obsess over that I didn&#8217;t have to set up. Each time I finish another video, much like finishing the music, a wave of accomplishment washes over me, releasing that ever-needed dopamine or serotonin or adrenaline or whatever. I get giddy just thinking about finishing another one soon.

**GAMING**
Finished up Mass Effect 2 a few weeks ago. It was a long, drawn-out affair due to me getting distracted by other things along the way, and I think my experience was marred by this, but it&#8217;s still a really sweet game. Epic and complex, for sure, as any good RPG should be, even if the storyline itself was kind of cookie-cutter. It&#8217;s like finishing a really long book that I can now put on my shelf, nod knowingly at, and move on. It sucks that the next long-form game I&#8217;m really looking forward to doesn&#8217;t come out until October (Fallout: New Vegas), but in the meantime the new XBL Lara Croft game has piqued my interest and I look forward to co-operating its faculties with a friend soon.

**FOR THE ROAD**
Work is familiar, yet different, since starting my new position a few weeks ago. My office is right next to the copier, so I get lots of visitors. This is not really a good thing for an introvert programmer, as each &#8220;visit&#8221; breaks my flow and makes me anxious. To be honest, I feel kind of invisible, yet very aware of my surroundings, much to my ironic dismay. Sigh. Makes ya stronger, though, right?
