<p>Despite getting caught up in Minecraft for most of the night, I was able to get in some coding tonight.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>By that, of course, I mean coding <em>setup</em>. What happens is that I don't code for a while and all my local versions of sites I work on atrophy. They differ from the live sites because over time I go and change the live sites directly because I'm too lazy to wait until I get home and do it right, with VCS and all. Well, that's gonna stop now. I got all my main sites wired up with Git, set up remote repos for each of them, and pushed at least an initial commit.</p>

<p>At least things are organized like they should be now. All I have to do is actually try to <strong>program</strong> for a change. That always seems difficult to actually start doing once you haven't in a long time.</p>
