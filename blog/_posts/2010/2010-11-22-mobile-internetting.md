I can update from my phone. The future is&#8230;yet to be written. The present, however, is decidedly super great pants ahoy.

Playing Fallout: New Vegas, &#8220;reading my book&#8221; as it is in our household, is simultaneously relaxing and nerve-wracking. When I&#8217;m doing fetch quests or conversing with NPCs, it is relaxing. When I&#8217;m in combat, it&#8217;s stressful. The enemies, even on Normal, are total bitches sometimes! Avid saving is needed.

I _will_ finish exploring Vault 34, dammit.

**EDIT (Next Day): I totally finished exploring Vault 34. Made it out by the skin of my teeth, nearly dead from radiation and with several broken limbs. Wooooo!**
