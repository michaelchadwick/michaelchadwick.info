[Album of the NebyooMoment: Gamey Mixture](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/gamey-mixture)

**Another** new album already? Yes. Projects overlap for me a lot, or I&#8217;ll do a bunch of preliminary work at some point, let the project drop for a while, and then come back to it. So, things can tend to get finished near each other as each one gets more and more complete.

Videogames! Videogame music! These are two things I love. I&#8217;ve done a few [videogame](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/182) [remixes](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/133) in the past , but I&#8217;ve never tackled a mess o&#8217; them at once. There&#8217;s no common theme among the fourteen tracks that make up [Gamey Mixture](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/13) except that I worked on them all at the same time, so you may notice some similar approaches. Most are from the NES, but a few from other platforms sneaked in, too.

Here&#8217;s a list of games I tackled:

* [Startropics 1](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/228)
* [Bionic Commando](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/229)
* [Maniac Mansion](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/230)
* [Ufouria/Hebereke](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/231)
* [Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/232)
* [Shadowrun](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/233)
* [Final Fantasy 1](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/234)
* [Metal Gear 2: Snake&#8217;s Revenge](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/235)
* [Dragon Warrior 4](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/236)
* [Mega Man X](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/237)
* [Bubble Bobble](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/238)
* [Shadowgate](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/239)
* [Magician](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/240)
* [Sword of Hope](http://nebyoolae.com/songs/241)

P.S. If it gets me nodding my head to a sweet beat, or gets me banging my head to a rocking groove, then it was a success to me.

P.P.S. A huge shout-out to [Kathy](http://faintidea.net) for making the cover art for the album seen at the top-right. I asked and she produced a whimsical take on the title and some of the characters found within. Props, yo.
