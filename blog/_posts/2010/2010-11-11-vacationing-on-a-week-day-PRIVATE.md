Having one single day off in the middle of the work week is weird. It&#8217;s like a surprise weekend, but only half of one. Tomorrow I have to go back to work, and I know a lot of people are just going to take it off, but not me. Thus, I&#8217;m gonna feel pretty unmotivated to get much done, and it&#8217;s gonna feel like a wasted day. Ploo.

Today was productive, at least, though. I sold our DSs to some guy out of my car&#8217;s trunk in the middle of an El Torito parking lot. I even got near-cited for soliciting on private property. Then I took a bunch of DS and GBA games to GameStop and got $127 worth of store credit. Robyn and I got pertussis shots so we can actually see her cousin&#8217;s new baby. Then we jammed and conversated with Kathy for a few hours. Dinner so far has been _Numbers_ with chips and guacafauxle.

We&#8217;re gonna head to OC for Robyn&#8217;s brother&#8217;s birthday and to hang with her parents for the weekend. We haven&#8217;t seen them in about two months, which seems like a long time. On the other hand, I haven&#8217;t seen either of my parents since our wedding in January.

I think it&#8217;s time to go to Guitar Center to get more guitar hanger things. Yeah. It&#8217;s definitely time for that.
