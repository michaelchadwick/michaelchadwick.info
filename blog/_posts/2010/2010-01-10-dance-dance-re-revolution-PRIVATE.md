##### NEBS IN

I&#8217;m about to go play DDR. In an arcade. With someone else. And this is, like, an event in which I have purposefully planned in advance to now fulfill. I think the last time I did this was either with [wawwen_san](http://wawwen_san.livejournal.com/){.lj-user} or [girlnextdork](http://girlnextdork.livejournal.com/){.lj-user}. And that was years ago.

You see, I still like DDR, but I play it very rarely at home, let alone at an arcade. It&#8217;s kind of a hassle to do, and I started playing racquetball a few years ago, too, which kind of took over the &#8220;do some damned exercise every now and then&#8221; part of my life. Mostly because SDSU has been out of session for several weeks now, barring the ability to go there and use their facilities, I started to get more interested in playing DDR more often again.

Playing in public always brings more anxiety, though. I get really hot and sweaty quickly, but in the comfort of my own home, it&#8217;s not much of an issue. Also, despite owning a similar input mechanism in the Cobalt Flux pad, it&#8217;s still not the same as an arcade machine. Finally, there are _other people watching OMG JUDGEMENT_, and that can cause me to get flummoxed and mess up more often and not be **as cool**, which is the main currency 20-somethings trade in. Maybe when I turn 30 at the end of this year (OMGWTF), I magically won&#8217;t care so much about what other people think about me, but signs point to PROBABLY NOT.

Anyway, I am showered and shaved and dressed, Maggie is away somewhere, and Robyn and her parents are at a hair trial for the wedding (OMGtheweddingisinlessthan2weeksWTF). Time to get this magical mystery tour on the road.
