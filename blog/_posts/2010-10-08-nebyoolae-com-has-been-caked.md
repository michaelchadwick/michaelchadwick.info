[Nebyoolae.com](http://nebyoolae.com) is now a full-on [Cake](http://cakephp.org) app. What this means for you, the visitor, is that adding functionality will be a lot easier for me and more fun for you. In the near future, I'll be adding search capabilities, song commenting and ranking, and more tagging support for songs.
