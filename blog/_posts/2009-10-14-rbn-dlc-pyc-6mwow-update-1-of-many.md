I have completed a serviceable note chart for Expert Bass. Whew. I had less source material to go on, so I had to do more manual editing of notes than with drums (but not too much more).

Tomorrow, I aim to make a decent Expert Guitar chart, which will be both fun and challenging since I get to transcribe part of a rhythm guitar, lead guitar, AND solo guitar (wheeee!).
