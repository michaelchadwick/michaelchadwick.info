I&#8217;ve been reading through my [sizable archive of posts](https://blog.nebyoolae.com) (the majority of which came from my ~10 years spent on [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com) and are now private to protect all the people who I apparently had no problem with referring to by name all the time).

This is not too uncommon, as I&#8217;m wont to do this every, say, 6-12 months, reliving the nostalgia of my life using the most articulate record I know of.

I know it&#8217;s incredibly egocentric, but back in the day I was a good writer. You can tell from the way I wrote. There was a joy being had, one that I find very hard to conjure up anymore. It&#8217;s been said before, but I&#8217;ll say it again: I miss those days. I miss the community. I miss my seemingly unflaggable ability to type up some words almost every day to commemorate something worth recalling later.

I do **not** miss, however, the drama from my college and post-college days, though! Those days are the ones where we all spent a lot of time &#8220;finding ourselves&#8221; and going through relationships, and I was no exception. Not to say that I&#8217;ve totally figured myself out and where I&#8217;m going to be in 10 years or anything, but I&#8217;m much more stable than I was then. Still, I find value and amusement virtually reliving the ups and downs of my 20s. I&#8217;m really glad I blogged _then_, even if I don&#8217;t blog as much _now_. Posterity is important to me,

One part of a post caught my eye recently, and I quote it here: &#8220;I don’t think I’ve had someone attend something I was in very often in my life, and it’s a little depressing. Still, my time will come, because I’ll make it come. **I will have something that all my friends can come to, and I will feel validated**. I’ll be proud of myself or I’ll be damned.&#8221; That was from early 2003, several years before I met [Kathy](http://faintidea.net) and we became [Pure Yellow Colour](http://pyc.nebyoolae.com). It&#8217;s nice to know I finally got that &#8220;something&#8221;. Despite achieving little musical fame so far (or maybe ever), at least I&#8217;ll always have that. Thanks, Kathy!
