Even at 32, I&#8217;m still enamored by old video game music. However, I&#8217;m not obsessed with keeping them the way they are and can get behind reimagining them using new ideas and technology. We&#8217;re not restrained by 8 bits or limited space on a cartridge anymore.

Thus, I introduce **Gamey Stew**, a new collection of game remixes and covers.

<!--more-->

It&#8217;s a followup to [Gamey Mixture](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-mixture), another collection of game remixes and covers that I did back in September 2010. With both Gamey Stew, and its predecessor, my aim was to try to choose games (and, therefore, tracks) that hadn&#8217;t been covered by most of the mainstream remixes/covers I&#8217;ve seen in places like [OCRemix](http://ocremix.org) and the like. This was largely done to help stand out in a now-crowded field of people doing this very thing. However, the games and tracks on the album are all well-loved by me and not simply picked to be different. As usual, the style goes back and forth between dance-y electronica stuff and instrumental guitar rock stuff. You know you love it.

You can head over to [Bandcamp](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-stew) itself to stream the album for free. You can also download the whole thing for a measly five American dollars (or, I wager, whatever your country&#8217;s equivalent currency is).

If you want a quick two-minute slice of the whole album, check out this sampler platter I made for SoundCloud:
