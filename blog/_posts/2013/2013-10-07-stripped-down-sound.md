I love technology. I especially love music technology.

I harness the crazy awesome power of [Logic](http://www.apple.com/logic) for most of my musical creations, replete with samples and plugins and effects from all over the place. I&#8217;ve made my fair share of stuff in less grandiose, yet no less important, products like [Nanostudio](http://www.blipinteractive.co.uk/ "NanoStudio"), too. In addition, my iPhone and iPad are both full of fun little audio toys like [Musyc](http://www.fingerlab.net/website/Fingerlab/Musyc.html), [Figure](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/figure/), [Traktor DJ](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/traktor-for-ios/traktor-dj/), and [Bebot](http://www.normalware.com/). Regardless of the technology, much joy can be extracted from the myriad ways that computers can help facilitate making sound.

However, sometimes it&#8217;s enough to just pick up an old classical guitar that&#8217;s missing multiple strings and simply&#8230;_play_.
