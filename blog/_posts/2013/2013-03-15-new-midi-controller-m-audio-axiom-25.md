I sold a lot of old musical gear last week. I had received most as gifts or hand-me-downs over the last few years and I was looking to make a little cash, so they had to go. The gear included a classic drum machine, a synthesizer module, a preamp, a hardware compressor, and even a large 61-key MIDI keyboard. In general, I never used any of them, either because I didn&#8217;t need them or they took up too much space on my desk (I&#8217;ll let you guess which is which).

Regardless, I&#8217;ve never been a good piano player, and can&#8217;t usually realize my compositional ideas via keys, so the use of a full keyboard is not that paramount to me. However, manually inputting ALL of the notes and MIDI controller messages is a huge chore, and actually detracts from both the musicality and creativity my music might otherwise have. Thus, I figured it was time to really think about the kind of input device I wanted that was both enough-knobs-and-buttons-y, as well as portable so I could pick it up and bring with me somewhere and/or fit on my desk without commandeering it. The picture above says it all: I got an [M-Audio](http://m-audio.com) Axiom 25 MIDI controller, and I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.

Not only does it basically have all the features I think I&#8217;d want (couple octaves of keys, pitch/mod wheels, bunch of twiddly knobs, drum pads), but it also directly interfaces with Logic and maps a bunch of stuff automagically. I even acquired the thing used for a good discount from retail, and without the bothersome box and wrapping I&#8217;d just end up throwing away. Messing around in Logic for an hour last night made me feel fairly well acquainted with its abilities, but I&#8217;ve barely scratched the programmability of it. If I just make a whole piece with it, I&#8217;m sure the stuff I don&#8217;t understand quite yet will come.

To celebrate the event, I took [Camel Audio](http://camelaudio.com) up on a sale they&#8217;re having where you buy one sample library and get a second one of equal-or-lesser value free. Nabbed some neat guitar morph-y stuff, some ambient pads, and even some weird voices. The [Impulse OST](http://nebyoolae.com/album/impulse-ost) was essentially solely written using free sounds that came with their Alchemy sampler, so rest assured I dig their stuff.
