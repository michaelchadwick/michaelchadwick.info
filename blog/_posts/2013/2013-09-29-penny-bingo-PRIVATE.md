**THE SETUP**

One of the things about having a collie I did not expect is the abundance of comments people would make about her when out on a dog walk.

 **AN ANECDOTE**

One of the most unexpected examples came about a while ago when I was walking Penny around town, all the while listening to music on my iPhone (as I&#8217;m wont to do when walking her alone). I was in the musical zone, sweaty from walking a fair distance, and not really paying attention to anything except the audio coming through my headphones and the task of walking forward without injury. In other words, I wasn&#8217;t really looking for human interaction at the time.

However, at some point I noticed that a car had pulled over right next to me, prompting me to stop and hear them out. My preoccupied, disheveled self had not really afforded a large truck full of strangers beckoning me out of nowhere, so there was some palpable anxiety and annoyance. Thankfully, it turned out that it was just an interested couple who actually had two collies in the back of their truck, and just had to stop and find out about mine. Apparently, this breed is not really popular anymore and the sight of one drives some people to stop and talk to anyone who has one.

**SOME ADMITTANCE**

Now, I will admit that Penny is a nice-looking canine, who walks like a show dog, and obviously embodies America (Lassie!) and its amber waves of grain. It&#8217;s going to invite occasional public commentary and interaction. I just never expected it to happen as often, or as fervently, as it does.

**PENNY BINGO**

It occurs so frequently that Robyn and I recently devised a little game. We noticed four general comments keep coming up and decided they worked as a mini-Bingo-type challenge. If we could get all four statement types said about her in one day, that was an accomplishment. If they happened during one walk, then we&#8217;d really scored, hardcore-style.

The four statement types are as follows:

  1. (It&#8217;s) Lassie!
  2. Your dog&#8217;s nose is so long! (I know, wtf, right?)
  3. You really don&#8217;t see (that breed | collies) much anymore.
  4. I totally had one of those when I was a kid.

Depending on where we take her and when, we can often rack up more than one statement per walk. I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;ve ever gotten all four in one day, let alone one walk, but I feel like it&#8217;s possible.

I&#8217;m sure other breeds have similar stereotypical things said about them, and it&#8217;s not like I wouldn&#8217;t fall prey to this behavior myself, but after a while it just gets a little tiresome. Regardless, making a fun activity out of it is fun for everyone, as long as you are me or Robyn ;P
