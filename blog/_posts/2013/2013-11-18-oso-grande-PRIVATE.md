My wife and I made an impromptu visit to Big Bear Lake (and City) this past weekend. We used [vrbo.com](http://vrbo.com) to find someone who owned a quaint, 1BR/1BA cabin in the Sugarloaf area (a bit southeast of the lake) and was happy to rent it to us for the weekend. It may have only been about 300 sq ft, and the bathroom and kitchen were both a bit squooshy, but it worked out quite well for just the two of us. The picture above is taken from a loft that surrounds the massive stone fireplace and was created as extra sleeping space, but I just used it to get the photo. In general, the cabin was really nice, and well-maintained. Space was used efficiently and it has just about everything one could want. I feel like having one of my own someday in the future could be really cool.

We attempted to start a fire the first night, but failed. Open the flue _before_ lighting the fire /facepalm. Cellular connections were nonexistent, but the wi-fi was much better than I expected, so it felt like we never left home. There was plenty of chilling and TV watching and cocoa drinking as we tried to keep warm while the temperature fluctuated between the low 50s during the day and the mid 20s during the evening.

We saw Ender&#8217;s Game. We ate at several restaurants, be it fancy or greasy spoon. We eventually made a successful fire using one of those dummy, 3-hour-burn, not-actually-wood logs (and it burned and smoked for far longer than that, too (unfortunately, it provided little warmth)). We drank some wine. We visited a local laundromat. We walked through a full-moon-lit night to a nearby general store to buy ice cream and waste money on lotto scratchers. It was a nice weekend refuge.

Oh, and we went sledding down a non-snow-covered hill on rickety sleds before leaving.
