This app has a lot of negative reviews. Besides the &#8220;Settings&#8221; screen not actually making its own design and instead just iFraming the existing one, it&#8217;s not bad. Maybe it&#8217;s still super buggy or something?

Nothing to blog about really, so if you&#8217;re reading this, I apologize for the disparity between this space and greatness. Have a good day!
