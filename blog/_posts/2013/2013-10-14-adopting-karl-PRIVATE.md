    Karl sectional from IKE

## THE SETUP

It&#8217;s really strange how one day you&#8217;re just hanging around at IKEA, perusing a tasty new dark blue sectional named KARL(STAD), and the next day you&#8217;re sitting on the exact same couch _in your living room_.

## THE BACKSTORY

We&#8217;ve put together our fair share of furniture, a mix of IKEA and Target, but never a couch, man. It&#8217;s one of the few things we felt was better delivered than squeezed into the back of our Outback, and in the end it was definitely the right choice. I had just come back from walking the dog, looked up at the living room from the front entryway, and saw the top of a box. That meant it was **big**. There were, in fact, **four** large boxes, weighing anywhere from ~30lbs to 90lbs. Construction took about an hour and a half and now we have a comfy, form-fitting, capital-L lounge piece in our primary living quarters.

## THE JUSTIFICATION

Why buy KARL, you might ask? Didn&#8217;t we already have a pretty nice place to sit? Well, yes. Our previous couch, which was not as big and not as sectional (i.e. not a couch + sofa + corner piece), was overstuffed, made of microfiber, and quite comfy, actually. We didn&#8217;t _not_ like it, but we _did_ like the sectional we had purchased a few years ago for our downstairs space, and perhaps that slight implicit preference crept into the main living space psyche. Having the dark green microfiber couch plus 2 POANG chairs was not as&#8230;_seamless_ a seating arrangement, _I guess_. Really, there&#8217;s no super justifiably good reason for just up and buying a new couch, but when you&#8217;re in a DINK arrangement and you got the funds, ambition, and time to do it, you go to IKEA on a Saturday, eat some meatballs, and then more-or-less spend a lot of money. In the end, there is now a great place for multiple people to sit upon on all three floors of our house (yes, we moved the green couch upstairs and into our once-empty loft area). And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about, right?

We also got some wall sconces, which I&#8217;d only really previously been aware of because of The Sims. As far as I know, sconces are just any kind of wall fixture that (can provide?) provides light. They take up less floor space with a huge base like our old college-era pole-sitting uplights. That allows for maximum couch-to-wall proximity. They do come with some ugly hanging wire baggage, however, so we&#8217;ll have to think about how to handle that better soon enough.

## FOR THE ROAD

And that&#8217;s how we came to bring KARL into our home. Several pieces of furniture in our home probably have names, but our couch has the most normal, English-sounding one, so the couch/sofa/sectional will now be referred to as such. Let&#8217;s just hope he doesn&#8217;t bring the Bay Area fog with him.
