A few weekends ago, I got to play guitar in front of complete strangers, most of which I did not interact with&#8230;except _through song_. Yes, I did another (paid!) gig, the opportunity of which was culled from that mysterious UCSD [Musicians Referral List](http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/about/musicians_referral.php) that somehow people find on the Internet and then use to possibly contact me via.

<!--more-->

I&#8217;m number #2 on the list, which is alphabetical, right behind some guy named Joe, so I have a good chance of being contacted. However, he has a website listed, and it is a standard &#8220;I&#8217;m a working musician website&#8221; kind of deal, which is inviting. I don&#8217;t even have a website listed, nor do I really have one that fits the bill (I should tell the moderators of the list to add [Stringing You Along](http://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/stringing-you-along), if nothing else (**edit: and so notified**)). What I&#8217;m trying to say is that I probably don&#8217;t come off as exceedingly pro, and that&#8217;s basically true. I&#8217;m a novice hired gun, based on experience playing live alone. I&#8217;ve been playing for 16+ years, though, and am competent, and I&#8217;m nice, and I&#8217;m cheap. These things work in my favor if I&#8217;m ever contacted, which is rare.

But! To bring this back around to The Point(tm), I **was** contacted, and I did perform, and it went pretty well. I played ~22 pieces over about 70 minutes. The setlist consisted of the following (_italics_ denotes originals):

Playing guitar in public is not something I do much. The bulk of such experience is largely encapsulated by Pure Yellow Colour, and I at least had a partner in crime during that tenure. Anxiety is a daily part of life, and expressing myself creatively to people who may or may not want to partake conjures up a healthy dose of the stuff.

It&#8217;s a double-edged sword: I make and play music because I want other people to hear it and like it. The judgement inherent with such an enterprise brings anxiety, though. Being a nuisance is one of my worst fears. Playing at an event where you&#8217;re basically &#8220;background music&#8221; is great because the focus is not really on you, but it also means you&#8217;re kind of expendable. It&#8217;s one of those &#8220;enhances the experience, but does not make it&#8221; kind of situations. It&#8217;s a &#8220;as long as it&#8217;s complementary and not too distracting, it&#8217;s only really noticed if it&#8217;s not there&#8221;, catch-22 type of deals. It can be artistically (expressing creativity) unsatisfying on one level, while also being mechanically (playing an instrument) fulfilling. Weird, eh?

After all was said and done, I was thanked by the coordinator and the bride, and someone even asked for a business card, which I dispensed. It was great to just sit and play guitar, even if it&#8217;s sometimes hard to stay in the zone and not realize strangers are around. I kind of faded in and out of musical bliss, depending on the piece and its difficulty. Overall, it went pretty well and I think I played satisfactorily. It was a beautiful day and a pleasant venue, so I can&#8217;t complain.

As usual, it just makes me want to do it more often, so that the prospect causes me less anxiety and my confidence can actually stay at a decent level. Marketing/advertising is a hassle and I really don&#8217;t want to do it, though. For now, I will continue to coast along in relative obscurity until the next miraculous opportunity comes my way.
