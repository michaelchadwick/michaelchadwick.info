This is not an exciting post, unless you&#8217;ve been looking for more recent information modded onto some of the basic-info-about-me pages that lurk within this site&#8217;s confines. In the event that the slim, but possible, chance encounter described above is being made right now, then have two links: 1) [About](https://blog.nebyoolae.com/about/) and 2) [Music Studio](https://blog.nebyoolae.com/music-studio/).

An updating bug has been going around, and I caught it this morning, so both pages have many more of those helpful hyperlinks the web has to offer. The former, a little self-serving mixed with a little external-serving, directs you to some additional resources regarding me (and one other!). The latter is largely me updating a text database of musical gear with actual links to where you could either look up more information about them and/or purchase them for yourself, if you so choose.
