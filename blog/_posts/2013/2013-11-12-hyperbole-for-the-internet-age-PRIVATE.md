The [Lists](http://blog.nebyoolae.com/lists/) on this blog don&#8217;t get updated too often, let alone the [Books](http://blog.nebyoolae.com/lists/#books) part. I don&#8217;t really read novels (or even short stories) much, so that section doesn&#8217;t get much love. My wife recently got Allie Brosh&#8217;s new book, however, and since it&#8217;s based on her [wildly popular blog](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/) of the same name, I thought I&#8217;d take a peek.

Since it&#8217;s almost more pictures than words, I finished its 300+ pages rather quickly. It&#8217;s kind of a weird hybrid autobiography/comic book, and so perhaps it doesn&#8217;t belong on the list, but I&#8217;m putting it there anyway, since it&#8217;s touched so infrequently.

As for the book itself? It&#8217;s awesome. The new stories not found on the blog are not quite as good as the ones already shared, but they&#8217;re all worth your time. Even reading over some of the ones I was already familiar with was still fun. The entries about her dogs really make me smile and laugh because of some similar experiences with my own dog. The entries wherein she delves deeply into her current neuroses hit too close to home for me sometimes, which is a weird mix of &#8220;been there, man&#8221; and &#8220;omg what&#8217;s wrong with me/her&#8221;.

Her words are simple, but come across as genuine. Her pictures are crude, yet honest, and immediately identifiable from any meme. The whole thing reads like a cross between the random diary entries of a neurotic recluse and a carefully cultivated portfolio of an Internet genius. As long as I keep my emotional distance, I can just enjoy the weirdness of it all without becoming too concerned for the author&#8217;s well-being.

Hmm. Maybe I should try reading another book. And soon. While the momentum is churning.
