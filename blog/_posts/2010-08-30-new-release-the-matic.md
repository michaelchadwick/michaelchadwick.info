[Album of the NebyooMoment: The Matic](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/12)

You may have noticed, if you&#8217;ve been following this blog, that I recently created seven music videos under the guise of &#8220;The Matic Music Videos.&#8221; YouTube&#8217;s got the [whole mess of them](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=AFAC55BA232E03E6). Ranging in subjects from Alaska to cooking turkey stroganoff to springing TiVos out of jail, they were a blast to make.

Each video features music from my latest album release, aptly titled &#8220;The Matic.&#8221; All of the themes were created before the video, and before I even thought to add video to them. I&#8217;ve never done a &#8220;music video&#8221; in the past as it never really occurred to me, I didn&#8217;t have a video camera of any sort, and I didn&#8217;t have any video ideas.

Once Robyn decided to do a Picture of the Day for Some Amount of Time project, detailing the construction of the [Scripps Seaside Forum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btYKAvGp78A), the idea to take all those pictures and essentially animate them came into existence. Of course, there needed to be music to go along with it, and I had skill in that department, so I made some. Later, we got married there.

Well, some months afterward, after working on some disparate themes, I figured it might be fun to make some visuals for them. People like visuals. The failure point is that I can&#8217;t draw well at all. It is neither something I&#8217;m naturally gifted, nor do I have an overarching interest in. However, I can point a metal object at things and push a button, so videos were the answer. In the end, it seemed perfectly natural to give abstract &#8220;themes&#8221; a visual component.

Ideas came to me over the course of a couple months, which I then translated into scads of footage. The footage was then imported into my MacBook, furthermore into iMovie, and then _carefully arranged_ around the music. Usually, this meant cutting out 50-75% of the video shot for each one. Time lapse was a recurring element, as cliche as it may seem, but I like the effect. The [TiVo one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS525JYfNG8) is my favorite because it&#8217;s silly and actually tells a story, rather than just creating a mood.

The music runs the usual gamut of sonic interests, be it pop instrumental guitar or faux-orchestral bombast. It represents a good pastiche of what it is that I like to create when Logic is open and/or a guitar is in my arms.

Henceforth, just in case you were interested in listening to only the music sans video, [you are in luck](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/view/12). Enjoying the fruits of my labor, I hope you are.
