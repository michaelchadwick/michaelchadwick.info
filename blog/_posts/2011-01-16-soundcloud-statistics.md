I use [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) because their little visual music players are rad as hell. They are easily embeddable anywhere. Their interface is well-designed and fun to use. With a free account you only get so much space to upload music (unlike my own host), but there&#8217;s a community worth contributing to so I try to put my best tracks there.

Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t spend much time there listening to people&#8217;s stuff and commenting on things, much like the rest of the Internet. Fortunately, others have done me a service and listened and downloaded (and even commented a few times) on the tracks I&#8217;ve uploaded. Check out my overall stats:

I&#8217;ve posted a few of these on Reddit, most likely spearheading the traffic seen here. I started linking things right about where the graph goes from 0 on the y-axis to the top of that massive spike. Still, though&#8230;Undereke has over 300 plays? Whoa. It&#8217;s long and guitar riff-heavy, so I didn&#8217;t think it would appeal as much. It must just be the unusual name, prompting a click to find out what the hell something called that would sound like.
