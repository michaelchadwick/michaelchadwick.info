Everything is a little different at night, bathed in the pale moonlight or the stark streetlight.

In my latest video from the upcoming &#8220;The Matic&#8221; album we all take a little trip outside during the later hours. A tense soundtrack, self-titled, tries to draw you in while still putting you on edge at least a little.
