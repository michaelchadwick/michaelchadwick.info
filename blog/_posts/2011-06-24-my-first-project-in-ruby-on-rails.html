<p>Deep within the myriad web tutorials, eBooks, and tinkering/spelunking of others' projects on and with Ruby and Rails that I've penetrated with my curiosity comes an official announcement:<strong> I've embarked on my first, really real <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Check out the following <a href="https://nebyoolae.com/pyc">link</a>. Although you can't necessarily tell, this site is not built on a framework. It uses PHP for some light dynamic content, but there's no databases or tables. The newsfeed is just one long HTML file, <em>for Petra's sake</em>! The closest it comes to reusable coding practice is having a bunch of include files. Also, there is nary a touch of HTML5 or CSS3 modern goodness to see. Convention over configuration? DRY? Nope, son. The site as it stands is old-school web development.</p>

<p>I aim to change that.</p>

<p>That brings us to PYC on Rails, which will be a Rails 3 web app with a database and models and controllers and drop shadows that aren't brought to you in image form. It's gonna be all versioned nicely in <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and deployed using <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a>. It's gonna use <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Rubygems</a>. It's gonna be available on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> once it's public so anyone can see how it was made and pick it apart.</p>

<p>Obviously, it's not gonna be perfect, because it's my first site and I'm bound to do stupid beginner things. However, when it's done, it's gonna be a great jumping off point from the, uh, zeroth site I, um, do(n't?) have. Confidence++ when it's done, which will hopefully lead to doing some awesome stuff on <a href="http://morethingsneed.to">Morethingsneed.to</a> once I've got a better idea how RoR works.</p>

<p>Web development in my free time? <strong><em>I'm back</em></strong>.</p>
