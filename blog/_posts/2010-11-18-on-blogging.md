I know part of the reason for the lack of posting proper blog entries over the years is me. Yep. I got taken in by the allure of the 140-character status update, so much easier to spit out than a many-worded spiel on LiveJournal. Another part of the reason is _everyone else doing the exact same thing_. It&#8217;s like my friends all decided to move to a new city together and I joined them. Twitter was exciting: it was easy to contribute and there were lots and lots of updates, so the content feed rarely felt stale. Even figuring out how to sum up my current condition in a captioned snapshot was in itself an art form. Cleverness was needed to make them count. But that&#8217;s the thing with being clever: it rarely tells the whole story.

Challenging myself to come up with something to espouse on each day in a longer format has been a&#8230;uh, challenge. It reminds me of when I did [M.U.S.I.K.](http://nebyoolae.com/albums/4) back in 2006 (and in 2003, too). For those not initiated, M.U.S.I.K. was a ridiculous acronym I used to describe a month-long exercise in musical composition. Each day I had to come up with an idea, flesh it out, record it, and upload it. I even set up an RSS feed for the more recent one. NaBloPoMo has been very similar because both of them started out strong, mainly because I had a lot of ideas that I was just waiting to expand on, _restraining_ myself to only one entry a day. The songs were flowing mightily in the beginning, but after the halfway point each day was a struggle, wrenching whatever creative songcraft scrap I had tucked in my brain out and onto my hard drive.

I&#8217;m well past the halfway point of November&#8217;s blogging event, and it&#8217;s good to be posting regularly again. My friend Kim recently started blogging regularly in her LJ, once again letting me in on her mindspace on a continual basis, which pleases me greatly. Perhaps Twitter and Facebook micro-blogging will slow down due to my renewed interest in macro-blogging. We shall see, Internetizens. We shall see.
