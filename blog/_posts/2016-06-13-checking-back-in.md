The last time I updated this site, which has gone from a dump of my old LiveJournal, to a fairly recurring life blog, to a mainly defunct music blog, I had just recently become a father. In the following, oh, year and a half, I&#8217;ve been a little preoccupied with doing that thing.

**However**, I&#8217;ve found time, carved into the recesses of the night, to finish a couple more albums of music.

##### Quibblings OST

The second podcast I&#8217;ve been apart of, [Quibblings](http://soundcloud.com/quibblings-podcast), finished up its inaugural (and final) season a while back, but all the music I made for it is now in a handy Bandcamp album.

##### Northwest Passage

My family and another family went on a Disney cruise together back in late August/early September 2015, and during the downtime I _really explored the space_ (of the iPad version of Garageband). Of course, it wasn&#8217;t my first time using the app, but it was the most thorough. A mix of samples and synths, all themed by cities in the Alaskan/Southwest corner of Canada regions of our great country of North America.
