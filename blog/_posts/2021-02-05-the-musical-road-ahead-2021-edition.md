All right. It&#8217;s 2021. I&#8217;ve been making music since I was a teenager back in the mid-90s. I&#8217;m now 40 years-old and have finished dozens of releases in a variety of styles. What else is there to do?

Well, I&#8217;m glad I asked myself that!

## Gamey Goulash

I&#8217;m in the beginning stages of a new batch of video game covers, remixes, and rearrangements. Past efforts include [Gamey Mixture](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-mixture), [Gamey Stew](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-stew), and [Gamey Amalgam](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-amalgam), but it&#8217;s been almost 2 years since the most recent one, so it&#8217;s time to get back to revisiting my past&#8230;again.

I still remember when [The Minibosses](http://www.minibosses.com/) were a novel idea (whoa, they&#8217;re a rock band, but they&#8217;re playing old video game music!), but that time has passed. Due to the concept of reimagining bleeps and boops as meedlies and squeedlies no longer being new, my usual strategy when doing a video game remix album is to choose DEEP CUTS both in game and track so they stand out amongst the nth remix of Final Fantasy.

However, this time around, I&#8217;m purposely choosing popular tracks from popular games, and challenging myself to _really_ change the style so as not to sound like the 9595903495 remixes that already exist. My plans include using an electronic drumkit to record percussion (rather than using Logic Drummer or loops), and trying to use more live instrumentation (mandolin, for example).

## Pandemonium

[Fly Like Venus](https://flylikevenus.bandcamp.com), the sweet rock band I play six-string in, is getting _ruhl_ close to finishing its sophomore followup to [Scenes](https://flylikevenus.com/album/scenes). It&#8217;s taken almost four years, but principal recording for **Pandemonium** is basically done, so we&#8217;re in the &#8220;find minor issues and fix them&#8221; phase. This will then give way to the mixing and mastering phases, and then RELEASE.

It&#8217;s gonna be good, man.

## Other People&#8217;s Music

There are some music friends of mine making quality tunes that are inspiring me to want to do more covers, as well.

## For The Road

Despite doing this music thing for 25 years, I&#8217;m still excited to play and compose and create. Art is something that knows no age, so I can see myself doing this until my last day.

What madness will I unleash in the coming years? Only the future knows.

**_UPDATE @ 11:27am: I recently finished a list of all the [audio plugins](/audio-plugins) I&#8217;ve collected over the years. So, a new project is to actually go through and USE them. Yes, I&#8217;m guilty of collecting digital artifacts and then immediately forgetting to use them. Welp, let&#8217;s have 2021 be the year where that changes (maybe)._**
