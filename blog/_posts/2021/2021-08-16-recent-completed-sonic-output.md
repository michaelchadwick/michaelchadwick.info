In the past few months, I&#8217;ve been able to complete some new music, and I guess making a blog post about that is something people do, so&#8230;here it is.

[While You Rest](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/while-you-rest) is the second &#8220;quiet&#8221; release I&#8217;ve done where I intentionally tried to make less bombastic stuff (my usual go-to) that you might even be able to sleep to. The first one was [While You Wait](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/while-you-wait).

[Upgrade](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/upgrade) is technically only half &#8220;new&#8221; music, and even that music is heavily influenced by old dance/electronica tracks I made in the early 00s when I was first trying to do this kind of thing. Still, though, it&#8217;s a neat view into my &#8220;evolution&#8221; as a music maker, and finally encapsulates a certain genre I was really into then (and still am).

[Gamey Goulash](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/album/gamey-goulash) is the fourth release in a series of video game remix/cover/re-orchestration collections I&#8217;ve done over the last decade or so. It&#8217;s unique mainly in that I chose really popular tracks (including possibly the [most famous of all time](https://nebyoolae.bandcamp.com/track/platformer-stage-music)) instead of b-sides/deep cuts that I often choose.
