The awesome rock band that I play in just (well, recently) released a second album! It&#8217;s called Unwound, and it&#8217;s a definite sophomore release: similar to the first release, but more experimental.

Much of the recording was done at home, so it has a more &#8220;studio&#8221; feel to me. It has been a heavy couple of years for the world, and this album reflects the band&#8217;s feelings and thoughts during that time. If you listen closely, you may notice there is a bit of a Hero&#8217;s Journey vibe going on.

One can listen or purchase it from many places, as is the way these days:
