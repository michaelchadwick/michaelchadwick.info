    Waffle. Texas. Basically the same thing.
  </p>
</div>

In an attempt to skirt any kind of latent normalcy or conservatism, my wife and I, along with a couple friends, descended upon the capital of Texas, otherwise known as Austin. Our task? Witness some holy matrimony.

**TEXAS**

My experience with Texas is long, but scattered. After living there for a year in 8th grade, I amassed an extraordinary fondness for a few people that I left behind when my Mom and I relocated to San Diego, CA. In the time between now and then, I would visit the Lone Star State a handful of precious, yet meaningful, times.

I had never been to Austin, though, which seemed to be one of the more liberal parts. &#8220;Keep Austin Weird&#8221; could be found all over town. There was some graffiti on a wall and a cool musical instrument sculpture in the lobby of our hotel, kicking off this motif right away. In our hotel room we happened upon an old-school, blue telephone receiver (without a handset) that you could plug into a smartphone for that nostalgic feel, just cuz&#8217;. Oh! And they had a waffle iron that made its product in the shape of Texas itself. Weird, yo!

Shout out to the Hampton Inn in Downtown Austion for two more things, as well: 1) letting us hang out in the pool area beyond the cutoff time (and, later, the lobby), all the while boozing and chatting into the wee hours, and 2) upgrading my wife and me to a suite next to our room because, well, we asked.

Some interesting things about Austin, Texas (or just the south):

  * **Frontage roads**: a lot of highways have a road that runs alongside them all frontin&#8217; and such. It&#8217;s like they were here first and the new guy in town (i.e. the highway) is now their senior officer, but they work together despite their differences.
  * **Whataburger**: despite the name, there isn&#8217;t much exclamation for this dead cow-wich. One of our friends originally from Texas really loves it, though.
  * **H.E.B.**: a local grocery chain. We joked that it stood for something like &#8220;Horrendous Elephant Butt&#8221;, clearly no relation to its actual meaning. [Then I looked it up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-E-B). Mr. Butt, you were the, uh, rear-end of many jokes during our weekend, so thanks?
  * **[The Salt Lick](http://www.saltlickbbq.com/pages/driftwood.html)**: this was actually quite a ways outside Austin, but still some absolutely delicious, legitimate Texas BBQ
  * **Texas Chili Parlor**: dive bar with some good chili
  * **[Gourdough&#8217;s](http://www.gourdoughs.com/)**: fancy donut place. Banana pudding, maple bacon, and oreos and gummi worms are _totally_ valid donut toppings.
  * **[Friday Night Lights Driving Tour](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fmaps%2Fms%3Fmsid%3D200820848983010925650.0004a98d02a16205edfb0%26msa%3D0&ei=H5vmUq6VBcHtoATi4oLACA&usg=AFQjCNGw94ZbCEmmg2vOAxxb5SMRrkYW-w&sig2=mhi5oQmWhjCdAT_EPIktmQ&bvm=bv.59930103,d.cGU)**: FNL is a fantastic TV show, and a lot of it was filmed in and around Austin. We didn&#8217;t end up seeing most of the places, but we _did_ getÂ a picture in front of Coach&#8217;s house, and I&#8217;m sure the people across the road were shaking their heads as they thought &#8220;Jesus, not this again&#8221;.
  * **Generic commercial establishments**: on the way to the airport for our return trip, we drove past both a &#8220;Major Brand Gas&#8221; fueling station, and a &#8220;Muchos Imports&#8221;, uh, import(?) store.
  * **Costco**: basically the same, but the hard liquor is in a separate, yet connected, building, and is closed on Sunday

**WEDDING**

The actual reason for our visit to the Texas state capitol was to see our friends Candy and Andic&#8211;er, Andy and Candace tie the knot. We stayed in a hotel with them and a bunch of other friends we hadn&#8217;t seen in a while (miss ya already Matt, Molly, and Lea), and then walked down to the actual capitol building where they got wedded in a large rotunda on the grounds. You could see it from the ground level, but had to go through the main capitol entrance, take an elevator down, and then walk back the way you came to the main event.

It&#8217;s a public place, so plenty of people taking tours were milling about and got to witness the whole thing. Except for a delay in the proceedings making us all tap our feet a little (and pass the time with some mouth trumpet), it went off without a hitch and I was filled with warm fuzzies for the happy couple. They even had a mariachi band play &#8220;[The Final Countdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw)&#8221; prior to the ceremony. That&#8217;s sweet, yo.

Post-wedding, we moved to what was essentially a German Elk Lodge, all long, open hallway and large dance floor. A taco buffet was the main course, and it was yum. Bouquets and garters were tossed, feet were moved on a hardwood floor (I joined for the motown songs, but sat out for most of it), and sparklers were ignited to see off the newly-joined pairing. All in all, a pleasant evening was had.

To Andy and Candace, a long, wonderful life together! They started it by flying to Morocco the next day, so I&#8217;m optimistic.

**FOR THE ROAD**

There is more photographic (and moving photographic evidence) of many of the aforementioned shenanigans, but that&#8217;ll have to wait for later. Text (and the sole Texas waffle above) is all you get for now.
