Code(dev) + coda(music) + name + wanton need to use a specialized TLD = codana.me :)

This is the home for all the code, audio, and audio code developments by me, Michael Chadwick, now proudly brought to you by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Most of my code is open source and found on [Github]({{ site.gh_link }}). Music is usually done under the "Nebyoolae" name/brand, with singles and one-offs found on [Soundcloud]({{ site.sc_link }}), and full albums on [Bandcamp]({{ site.bc_link }}).
