Due to the unexpected relocation of my wife&#8217;s parents from a house they&#8217;ve lived in for more than 38 years, a piano&#8217;s fate left hanging in the balance.

Moving a piano is a pain, and they didn&#8217;t really play it much anymore, especially since my brother-in-law, the prime pianist of the household, was moving out into a small apartment where there was little space for such a large piece of playable furniture. I&#8217;d tinkered with it here and there on visits and knew it to be a nice little musical instrument, the kind I&#8217;d longed to have in my musical collection for over a decade, but didn&#8217;t want to spend the money or get into the hassle of getting one into our house.

However, this was a unique opportunity to get one for free (plus non-free moving costs), and keep a cherished artifact in the family. Thus, a deal was made: we figure out how to get it to our place, and it would be ours. A few phone calls later and another arrangement was cast with a local piano moving company who said they&#8217;d do the job. One fateful Saturday morning that very same company did just as they said they&#8217;d do. It only took a few hours, and the source and destination locations were pretty easy to maneuver around in (our place required tipping the piano vertically for a short period of time, though). And now we have an upright piano in our downstairs bedroom amongst the guitars and basses and violins.

I still can&#8217;t quite believe it when I look over from my desk. We have a piano! Now to actually learn to play it better than a novice.
