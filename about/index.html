<p><strong>Hi</strong> :-)</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Michael Chadwick</strong>, a.k.a. <a href="{{ site.neb_link }}">Nebyoolae</a>, and I'm both a <code>software developer</code> and audio guy. I like to tinker with <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}">code</a>, and I also like to make patterned, and sometimes unpatterned, air movements, often in a <a href="/music-studio">room</a>. We all need a <a href="/audio-plugins">little help</a> sometimes, and I'm no exception.</p>

<p>Occasionally, these interests intersect and I make stuff that <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}/utter">incorporate</a> <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}/audiohash-win">both</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out on <a href="{{ site.tw_link }}">Twitter</a>, <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}">Github</a>, or <a href="https://bandcamp.com/contact?b=280146015&n=Nebyoolae&email=nebyoolae%40gmail.com">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>If you enjoy writings on code, music, and the analysis of said code or musicks made, then you&#8217;re at the right place.</p>

<p>I chose my online moniker many years ago and it&#8217;s what I use to identify myself almost everywhere on the Internet. &#8220;Doing stuff on the computer&#8221; has been a hobby since I played Oregon Trail and learned about HyperCard back in junior high. Making music and building websites came around the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>Besides making just <a href="{{ site.bc_neb_link }}">my own music</a> (sketches and ideas are <a href="{{ site.sc_n_link }}">here</a>, too), I&#8217;ve also dabbled in projects with others. The most notable one is <a href="https://nebyoolae.com/pyc">Pure Yellow Colour</a>. My friend <a href="https://faintidea.net">Kathy</a> (who <a href="https://valdoria.rocks/">rocks</a>, by the way) and I joined forces and made a pretty cool acoustic rock duo. We put out an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/primary/id279571887">album</a>, played a bunch of <a href="http://www.lestats.com">open-mics</a>, played a few long-form shows, and generally made each other better musicians (maybe).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also jammed several times with my friend Russ, as well as some others. He plays drums and I play guitar and we let that&#8230;<em>occur</em> for several hours every so often. We play in his <a href="https://neb.host/audio/mcj">Man Cave</a>. In the last few years, more people have joined us and we formed <a href="http://flylikevenus.com">Fly Like Venus</a>, which still rocks out from time to time.</p>

<p>I tend to get lost in making web or music projects, and when that current obsession is done, I&#8217;ll usually chase it by getting engrossed in playing some video game until I either finish it or think of another web or music project to do (see the vicious cycle there?).</p>

<p>My personage made up 1/3 of <a href="https://neb.host/podcasts/tem">The Escort Mission</a> and its triumphant podcast. It is now defunct, but all the episodes are online to listen to for free. The same three dudes reconvened years later to make <a href="https://neb.host/podcasts/quib">Quibblings</a>, which is also now defunct, but the content is there for the listening. I'm currently broadcasting with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/massmesserman">@MattMesserman</a> on the <a href="{{ site.htg_link }}">Hacking the Grepson podcast</a>, a tale of two career programmers musing about their professions in a hopefully helpful way.</p>

<p>My wife is a <a href="http://birdiebloggery.wordpress.com">blogger</a>, baker, photographer, and general computer expert.</p>
