  <strong>Hello</strong>, <em>Hola</em>, <em>Oi</em>, <em>Hej</em>, <em>Aloha</em>,
  <em>Bonjour</em>, <em>Hallo</em>, <strong>やあ</strong>, and <strong>嘿</strong>!
</p>

<p>
  My name is <strong>Michael Chadwick</strong>, a.k.a. <a href="{{ site.neb_link }}">Nebyoolae</a>, I live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/California/@35.8949354,-137.2963832,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fb9fe5f285e3d:0x8b5109a227086f55!8m2!3d36.778261!4d-119.4179324" target="_blank">California</a>,
  and I'm both a <code>software developer</code> and
  <a class="musical-tone" href="#" title="click for a tone">audio guy</a>. I like to tinker with
  <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}">code</a>, and I also like to make patterned, and sometimes
  unpatterned, air movements, often in a <a href="/music-studio">room</a>. We all need
  <a href="/audio-plugins">help</a> sometimes, and I'm no exception.
</p>

<p>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>
  Occasionally, these interests intersect and I make stuff that
  <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}/utterly">incorporate</a>
  <a href="{{ site.gh_link }}/audiohash-win">both</a>.

  Use Spotify and wanna

  <summary>Various Bits of Tid About Myself</summary>
  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i>
    If you enjoy writings on code, music, and the analysis of said code or musicks made, then you're
    at the right place!
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-signature"></i>
    I chose my online moniker many years ago and it&#8217;s what I use to identify myself almost
    everywhere on the Internet. &#8220;Doing stuff on the computer&#8221; has been a hobby since I
    played Oregon Trail and learned about HyperCard back in junior high. Making music and building
    websites came around the mid-1990s.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i>
    Besides making just <a href="{{ site.bc_neb_link }}">my own music</a> (sketches and ideas are
    <a href="{{ site.sc_n_link }}">here</a>, too), I&#8217;ve also dabbled in projects with others.
    The most notable one is <a href="https://pureyellow.bandcamp.com">Pure Yellow Colour</a>. My
    friend <a href="https://faintidea.net">Kat</a> (who <a href="https://valdoria.rocks/">rocks</a>,
    by the way) and I joined forces and made a pretty cool acoustic rock duo. We put out an
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/primary/id279571887">album</a>, played a bunch of
    <a href="http://www.lestats.com">open-mics</a>, played a few long-form shows, and generally made
    each other better musicians (maybe).
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar"></i>
    I&#8217;ve also jammed several times with my friend Russ, as well as some others. He plays drums
    and I play guitar and we let that&#8230;<em>occur</em> for several hours every so often. We play
    in his <a href="https://neb.host/audio/mcj">Man Cave</a>. In the last few years, more people have
    joined us and we formed <a href="http://flylikevenus.com">Fly Like Venus</a>, which still rocks
    out from time to time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-spin"></i>
    I tend to get lost in making web or music projects, and when that current obsession is done,
    I&#8217;ll usually chase it by getting engrossed in playing some video game until I either finish
    it or think of another web or music project to do (see the vicious cycle there?).
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-podcast"></i>
    My personage made up 1/3 of <a href="https://neb.host/podcasts/tem">The Escort Mission</a> and its
    triumphant podcast. It is now defunct, but all the episodes are online to listen to for free. The
    same three dudes reconvened years later to make
    <a href="https://neb.host/podcasts/quib">Quibblings</a>, which is also now defunct, but the
    content is there for the listening. I'm currently broadcasting with my friend
    <a href="http://messerman.org">Matt</a> on the
    <a href="{{ site.htg_link }}">Hacking the Grepson podcast</a>, a tale of two career programmers
    musing about their professions in a hopefully helpful way.

    My wife has blogged, baked, drawn, and photographed, all the while being a
    <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/robynachadwick">general computer expert</a>.
